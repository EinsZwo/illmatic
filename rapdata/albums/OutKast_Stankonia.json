Forever, ever?\nForever never seems that long until you're grown\nAnd notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong\nMs. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could\nBecome a magician to abracadabra all the sadder\nThoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he\nAsking what happened to the feeling that her and me had\nI pray so much about it, need some knee pads\nIt happened for a reason, one can't be mad\nSo know this, know that everything's cool\nAnd yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation\n[Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\n\"Look at the way he treats me\"\nShit, look at the way you treat me\nYou see, your little nosy-ass homegirls\nDone got your ass sent up the creek, G\nWithout a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out\nNow you and your girl ain't speakin' no more\n'Cause my dick all in her mouth\nKnow what I'm talkin' about?\nJealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating\nIn the year 2G, they be the same thing\nSo who you placin' the blame on?\nYou keep on singin' the same song; let bygones be bygones\nAnd you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama\n[Chorus: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times\nI'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real\nNever meant to make your daughter cry\nI apologize a trillion times160Embed"

(Huh?)\nApparently not, that's why you get what you got\nNow answer this: do you know what fire is? (Yeah!)\nThe body of hot, the motivator of pots\nSnot, spit, shit are characteristics of release\nAsk your niece or nephew, you think we left you\nWhat the future holds in its sweaty palms\nThink I'm finna vom'?\nYou move it like you mean it, she'll come\nProm night might excite a down right fight like\nWhite blood cells to the common cold rebel\nNight gets jealous of day, play is no longer\nThe feelin' gets stronger than ammonia sticks inhale\n[Chorus: Witchdoctor]\nWe just can't be amazed\nEven if you pull the pin from your hand grenade\nWe just can't be amazed\nEven if you pull the pin from your hand grenade\nWe just can't be amazed\nEven if you pull the pin from your hand grenade\nWe just can't be amazed\nAnd we some home-made bombs\nFinna blow right up in your face\n[Verse 2: B-Real]\nLook at the way you look at me, I see it on your face\nAll your hate emanates, but you still hesitate\n'Cause you want inside of my head, but don't know how\nTo brainwash me to be a commercial clown\nFuck that, I see the way you were\nSee the way you smirk\nI'm catching you where you work\nGod only knows all the trouble that grows\nDeep beneath my soul dealing with you assholes\nCan I blast those who point the finger at me\nWho criticize and talk shit so freely\nFuck XXL\u2014you're a size too small\nI should hire Eminem so we can kill you all\nWhether you live to talk shit about the Real\nThen kiss my ass in person how much you love the Hill\nI'm the outcast coming to blaze the grass\nOutlaw due to my life that's come to pass\nDr\u00e9, pass me the glass of wine\nSo I can pour it over my homies grave and mine\nFor all those who fallen and answered when God was calling\nJump into my ragtop and get all in\nI'm the bomb, planted in your car\u2014why you frozen?\nPop the tape in ignite the explosion\nThe world is mine, the world is yours, the world is ours\nThe world is lost, the world is tossed\nYou might also like[Chorus: Witchdoctor]\nWe just can't be amazed\nEven if you pull the pin from your hand grenade\nWe just can't be amazed\nEven if you pull the pin from your hand grenade\nWe just can't be amazed\nEven if you pull the pin from your hand grenade\nWe just can't be amazed\nAnd we some home-made bombs\nFinna blow right up in your face\n\n[Verse 3: Big Boi]\nWith a one-two punch, B-Real and Andr\u00e9 drop they verses\nYour homeboy Daddy Fat Sax playin' clean-up, so it worsens\nPeople and persons on the opposite teams, oh, yes, its curtains\nNo bullets burpin', oh, just lyrically twerking, oh\nMaking a statement when you freestyle and your mind is in a free state\nIt's kinda hard to execute when you ain't feeling it that day\nJumpin' the gun and rushing your flow\nBabbling on the mikie like auctioneer\nGot the public's ears fucked up, can't hear\nAtlanta, Georgia where y'all at? (right here)\nOutKast this Dirty South to death the Dungeon Family Camp\nGot this thang licked like stamps and nine-volt battery end caps\nMaking that music that make your neck hurt\nAnd the beats that bother your back in my Cadillac\nSix woofers and four amps\nLo pro vogues on swole, with the carriage lamps\nDiamond tucked velour pistol in my lap\nCome in peace, but then explode like boobie traps\n[Chorus: Witchdoctor]\nWe just can't be amazed\nEven if you pull the pin from your hand grenade\nWe just can't be amazed\nEven if you pull the pin from your hand grenade\nWe just can't be amazed\nEven if you pull the pin from your hand grenade\nWe just can't be amazed\nAnd we some home-made bombs\nFinna blow right up in your face\n\n[Outro: Debra Killings]\nDo-do-do, do, do-do-do\nDo-do-do, do, do-do-do\nDo-do-do, do, do-do-do\nDo-do-do, do, do-do-do5Embed"

steady watching myself, got eyes in my back\nDon't take no slack when you managing the trap, if you work out, gotta get it right back\nI trap by day, boy, rap by night, C-Bone in this bitch, College Park trump tight\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nDo you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?\nDo you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?\nDo you really wanna know about some gangsta

Candyland, it's Slimm, the southpaw triggerman\nFlippin' work and whippin' weight, rock up, roll and get the papes\nChop them hoes and then you skate, back to the block wit the deflate\nGrams the O's, slabes to whole one's da flake\nA young nigga holdin big face foldin'\nPimps are known for catching runaways\nA good hustler's known to keep his gun away\nFirst nigga run up and try to jack mine\nFirst nigga fuck up to get flat-lined\nPack still stainless Coupe and Verts brainless\nY'all don't wanna fuck wit me, the trunk be  bangin\nOff the chain danglin', y'all know that I'm from CP\n(When do ya shoot boy, shot don\u2019t reverse, send to the downtown send for the nurse)\n\n[Chorus]\nDo you really wanna know about some gangsta shit?\nDo you really wanna know about some gangsta

tryna impress God\nWe'll pull your whole deck, fuck pulling your card\nAnd still take my guitar and take a walk in the park\nAny play the sweetest melody the street ever heard\nNow bitches sucking on my nouns and I'm eating their verbs\nGet full, and niggas, niggas\nPop, pop, lock, lock to the, to the beat, beat\nAs if pitbulls went out of style, made a vow to myself\nIf it's for the wealth I'll stop, well put it like this\nIt's like me selling some dope because my girlfriend wants to shop\nWrong reason, whatever the season, hey winter, spring, summer or fall\nI dont stall, slow drag wit' your brain against the wall\nYeah, nigga, naw, we lean to the side don't fall\nAll y'all fuckboys, tuck toys inside your pants\nJust to pull it out, point it at the ground and make a nigga wanna dance\nNow what that be for? You're on that reefer and on that 2Pac\nIn front of them ooh-wops, trying to show out, that's the ho route\nTalking loud talking bout that's gangsta shit4Embed"
