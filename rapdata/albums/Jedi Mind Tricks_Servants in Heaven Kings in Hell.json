You shouldn't answer that\nIf my father was still alive, he wouldn't stand for that\nHe wouldn't stand for how you act like a bitch\nWouldn't stand for anybody who a rat or a snitch\nI'm back in this bitch, we was gone for a while\nUntil a shorty told me that he heard my song and he smiled\nI'm strong but I'm wild, they say I drink too much\nThe only problem that I have is that I think too much, pussy!3Embed"

    "lyrics": "Uncommon Valor: A Vietnam Story Lyrics[Intro: Richard Nixon (US Government PSA)]\n\"I have spoken to you from this office, where so many decisions have been made that shaped the history of this nation.\"\n\"I have always tried to do what was best for the nation.\"\n(Duck\u2026\u00a0and cover!)\n([?])\n\n[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]\nYeah\nI don't know why I'm over here, this job is evil\nThey sent me here to Vietnam to kill innocent people\nMy mother wrote me, said: \"The President, he doesn't care.\"\nHe tryin' to leave the footprints of America here\nThey say we tryin' to stop Chinese expansion\nBut I ain't seen no Chinese since we landed\nSent my whole entire unit, thinkin' we could win\nAgainst the Vietcong guerrillas there in Gia \u0110\u1ecbnh\nI didn't sign up to kill women or any children\nFor every enemy soldier, we killin' six civilians\nYeah, and it ain't right to me\nI ain't got enough of motherfuckin' fight in me\nIt frightens me, and I just wanna see my son and moms\nBut over here they droppin' seven million tons of bombs\nI spent my days dodgin' all these booby-traps and mines\nAnd at night prayin' to God that I get back alive\nAnd I'm forced to sit back and wonder\nWhy I was a part of Operation Rolling Thunder\nIn a foxhole with nine months left here\nJungle like the fuckin' harbinger of death here\n[Interlude: Vinnie Paz + R.A. The Rugged Man]\nI don't wanna be here, I'm scared, I just wanna go home\nYou fucking kidding me?! Don't be a pussy!\nDon't you love your country?!\nI like being here (True story), I'm ready\n[Verse 2: R.A. the Rugged Man]\nCall me Thorburn, John A., staff sergeant\nMarksman, skilled in killin', illin', I'm able and willin'\nKill a village elephant, rapin' and pillage a village\nIllegitimate killers, U.S. Military guerrillas\nThis ain't no real war, Vietnam shit\nWorld War II, that's a war, this is just a military conflict\nSoothin' drug abusin', Vietnamese women screwin'\nSex, gamblin', and boozin' \u2014 all this shit is amusin'\nBitches and guns, this is every man's dream\nI don't wanna go home where I'm just an ordinary human being\nSpecial Op, Huey chopper gunship, run shit\nGook run when the minigun spit, won't miss\nKill shit, spit four-thousand bullets a minute\nVictor Charlie, hair-trigger, hit it, I'm in it to win it\nGet it, the lieutenant hinted, the villain, I been it\nThe killin', I did it, cripple, did it\nPictures I painted is vivid, live it\nA wizard with weapons: the secret mission, we 'bout to begin it\nGovernment-funded, behind enemy lines\nBullets is sprayin', it's heatin' up a hundred degrees\nThe enemy's the North Vietnamese, bitch, please!\nAin't no sweat, I'm totally at ease\nUntil I see the pilot got hit, and we 'bout to hit some trees\nTail rotor broke, crash land\nAmerican man in Cambodia, right in the enemy hand\nTake a swig of the whiskey to calm us\nThem yellow men wearin' black pajamas\nThey wanna harm us, they all up on us\nBang bang, bullet hit my chest, feel no pain\nTo my left, the Captain caught a bullet right in his brain\nBody parts flyin', loss of limbs, explosions\nBad intentions, I see my best friend's intestines\nPray to the one above, it's rainin', I'm covered in mud\nI think I'm dyin', I feel dizzy, I'm losin' blood\nI see my childhood, I'm back in the arms of my mother\nI see my whole life, I see Christ, I see bright lights\nI see Israelites, Muslims and Christians at peace, no fights\nBlack, Whites, Asians, people of all types\nI must've died, then I woke up, surprised I'm alive\nI'm in a hospital bed, they rescued me, I survived\nI escaped the war, came back\nBut ain't escape Agent Orange: two of my kids born handicapped\nSpastic, quadriplegia, microcephalic\nCerebral palsy, cortical blindness \u2014 name it, they had it\nMy son died, he ain't live\nBut I still try to think positive, \u2018cause in life, God take, God giveYou might also like63Embed"

He brung that\nAlong with the .44 militant gun rap\nI break bread with the brothers I trust\nCause I know that if I'm ever in some trouble, they bust\nCould never be us, we too raw for the rap now\nAnybody with a tape recorder can rap now\nI pull a twelve gauge shot at you, back down\nAnd then the last thing you hear is the gat sound\nFrom the city where they framed Mumia\nWe gonna break him out, run up with them flames and heaters\nYou might also like[Hook: Shara Worden]\nWhen all the light goes out, where will you be?\nWhen the darkness comes, what will you see?\n(When the lights go out)\nWhen all the light goes out, where will you be?\n(When the lights go out)\nWhen the darkness comes, what will you see?\n\n[Verse 3: Vinnie Paz]\nI carry heavy fists, I'm a biological terrorist\nIf you ain't been in war, then you don't know what terror is\nYou try to help people but do nothin' like therapists\nIt's basic rules to the game, cousin, you never snitch\nOr you can see the type of lead that my Beretta spits\nOr take you through the torture chamber and behead the bitch\nYeah, I'll put your body to the blades and choppers\nAnd teach you about the disruptive symbol of chakras\nIf you believe what they tellin' you, the beast and them won\nThat's why I speak about survival and need for a gun\nI stand for what them thugs is repping'\nBut they don't know the government is usin' drugs as weapons\nAnd drug injections, was taught by the prophets before\nAbout the cavalry of shadowy prophets of war\nIt's hard to grip, so I spit it at a different degrees\nBut the inner earth holds more water than seas\n[Bridge: Shara Worden]\nWho's gonna save you when all the lights go out?\nIt's time to reconcile, how you gonna go, how you gonna go?\nWhen the lights go out, when the lights go out\nWhen the lights go out, how you gonna go?

Army of the Pharaohs\nCheck it out, yo...\n\n[Hook: King Syze]\nBest believe, we roll up on your squad like a blitzkrieg\nBetter get your man, or would you rather see him bleed?\nWe here now, we ain't got time to wait\nMake no mistake, real niggas challenge their fate\n[Verse 1: Vinnie Paz]\nYeah...yeah this is war, cousin; I cock the hammer and kill\nIt's Vinnie Pazienza outta Hamburger Hill\nYou ramblin' still? We scramblin' still\nIf the beast doesn't get you, then the ambulance will\nSo hand me your steel...I fire iron when\nI find a faggot caught in the spell of Leviathan\nI keep my eye on him...cause he a bastard\nSever the head of the gator in Lake Placid\nYou motherfuckers is blind, you need glasses\nI seen how the game changed, I adapted\nI seen how your dame changed to my madness\nI seen how your brain maimed by my axes\nBut you a fascist...and y'all thugs\nYou as genuine as a mother-in-law's hug\nWe the veterans that'll be sendin' y'all slugs\nBut we gentlemen, so tell 'em it's all love\n\n[Verse 2: King Syze]\nYeah, yo...yo I'm demented, nigga; be prepared for what you facin'\nThe mind of God and Satan combined with domination\nI'm the rawest, roughest, toughest thing you ever heard of\nIn my studio session, blessin', MC's be gettin' murdered\nI'm one of a kind, puttin' one up in your fuckin' spine\nWhen I get to shine, believe it's through the grind\nDamn right, we cocky; I feel no one can rock with us\nI bless a mic religous on track, I'm spittin' ignorant\nSomethin' you've never heard, dynamic with every word\nGigantic with every slur, most stagnant with every herb, yo\nBut more polluted, this beat's therapeutic solution\nMy distribution sentence rappers into execution\nDeath row, Syze got the best flow\nY'all lazy motherfuckers talkin' 'bout \"Leeet's blow!\"\nAll of us; Q-D plus\nYeah, we goin' right by you like an off-duty bus, nigga\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Esoteric]\nAiyyo my words murder sets, I'll blitzkrieg your league like a German vet\nBull's eye, slash through your turtleneck\nAnd bones to pick, hit two hundred and six\nI'm runin' with cliques that'll hit you like a ton of bricks\nStraight put you in a ditch like a mob-related death\nI'll take it to your chest, make a mess of your flesh\nMy paragraphs breed hate\nI was sent to Heaven, resurrected with a clean slate, now I sleep late\nMen in each state dead from this\nThe Esoterrorist, a real motherfucker like Oedipus\nYour patheticness is why...you motherfuckers touch the mic and die\nGuilty is the plea, King Syze the co-D\nThey won't let us go free...Bloodthirsty killers\nPsychological thriller, beatin' my chest like gorillas\nWe got the city on smash, y'all pity's just trash\nWhile you small-timers finishin' last\n\n[Hook] {2X}Embed"
