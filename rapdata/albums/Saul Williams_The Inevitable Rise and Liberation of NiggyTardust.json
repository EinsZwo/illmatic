He can't deny what he know's true\nWhat the preacher gonna say? Preacher can't shit, girl, the preacher gay\nWhat your granny gonna do? She can't deny the truth\nHey, NiggyTardust, here to stay\nPaint him on your lunchbox or your thermos, for a fee\nYou might win the chance to hang with Niggy for a day\nSide effects may include simply doing what you say\nHey, NiggyTardust, no guitar\nGhetto Gothic millionaire, a super-duper star\nSide effects may include simply being who you are\nYou are yourself, my darling dear, and were never a nigga\n\n[Chorus: Saul Williams & CX KiDTRONiK]\nWhen I say Niggy, you say nothing\nNiggy, Niggy\nWhen I say Niggy, you say nothing\nNiggy (Nothing), shut up\nWhen I say Niggy, you say nothing\nNiggy, Niggy\nWhen I say Niggy, you say nothing\nNiggy (Nothing), shut up\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Saul Williams]\nSo what y'all niggas wanna do?\nI'm standing at the Pearly Gates so you can run and get your crew\nI'm knockin' once then I'm bustin' through\nWith some gold Diadoras and a shirt that reads, \"Do unto who?\"\nWhat y'all niggas wanna do?\nElevate the race or love these other motherfucker's too?\nThe choice is yours, which means it's up to you\nBut how can I love myself if I can't love you?\n\n[Outro: Saul Williams]\nNiggyTardust\nNiggyTardustEmbed"

Let these niggas get got!\nLying on the black top, relying on the have-nots\nYou're gonna get got! Get popped! Get cocked!\nLet these niggas get got! Let these niggas get got!\n\n[Chorus]\nThere has to be some other way to stop the fight\nI was raised to be lowered, was I raised to be lowered?\nI was raised to be lowered, was I raised to be lowered?\nEach day we sing and pray for guidance through the night\nI was raised to be lowered, was I raised to be lowered?\nI was raised to be lowered, was I raised to be lowered?\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nHallelujah, all these other suckas make me sick\nInshallah, we've come this far, the past can suck my dick\nBlessed be the virgin, especially if she's nice and thick\nMay your first time be full of grace, respect, and not a trick\nFirst communion, sacred as the day you were conceived\nBorn in sin? Nah, think again, repent and disbelieve\nHeaven is between your thighs, there lies the trick, deceived\nHoly blood shed once a month until you nurture seed\n\n[Outro]\nWas I raised to be lowered?\nWas I raised to be lowered?\nWas I raised to be lowered?

    "lyrics": "List of Demands (Reparations) Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI want my money back\nI'm down here drowning in your fat\nYou got me on my knees praying for everything you lack\nI ain't afraid of you\nI'm just a victim of your fear\nYou cower in your tower praying that I'll disappear\nI got another plan, one that requires me to stand\nOn the stage or in the street, don't need no microphone or beat\nAnd if you hear this song, if you ain't dead then sing along\nBang and strum to these here drums till you get where you belong\n[Chorus]\nI got a list of demands written on the palm of my hands\nI ball my fist and you're gonna know where I stand\nWe're living hand to mouth! You wanna be somebody?\nSee somebody? Try and free somebody?\nI got a list of demands written on the palm of my hands\nI ball my fist and you're gonna know where I stand\nWe're living hand to mouth\nHand to mouth\n\n[Verse 2]\nI wrote a song for you today while I was sitting in my room\nI jumped up on my bed today and played it on a broom\nI didn't think that it would be a song that you would hear\nBut when I played it in my head, I made you reappear\nI wrote a video for it and I acted out each part\nAnd then I took your picture out and taped it to my heart\nI taped it to my heart, dear girl, I taped it to my heart\nAnd if you pull away from me, you'll tear my life apart\n\n[Chorus]\nI got a list of demands written on the palm of my hands\nI ball my fist and you're gonna know where I stand\nWe're living hand to mouth! You wanna be somebody?\nSee somebody? Try and free somebody?\nGot a list of demands written on the palm of my hands\nI ball my fist and you're gonna know where I stand\nWe're living hand to mouth\nHand to mouth\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nEcstasy, suffering\nEchinacea, buffering\nWe aim to remember what we choose to forget\nGod's just a baby\nAnd her diaper is wet\n\n[Verse 3]\nCall the police, I'm strapped to the teeth\nAnd liable to disregard your every belief\nCall on the law, I'm fixin' to draw\nA line between what is and seems and call up a brawl\nCallin' 'em now 'cause it's about to go pow\nI'm standing on the threshold of the ups and the downs\nCall up a truce, because I'm 'bout to break loose\nProtect ya neck, 'cause son, I'm breaking out of my noose\n\n[Chorus]\nI got a list of demands written on the palm of my hands\nI ball my fist and you're gonna know where I stand\nWe're living hand to mouth! You wanna be somebody?\nSee somebody? Try and free somebody?\nGot a list of demands written on the palm of my hands\nI ball my fist and you're gonna know where I stand\nWe're living hand to mouth\nHand to mouth\nI got a list of demands written on the palm of my hands\nI ball my fist and you're gonna know where I stand\nWe're living hand to mouth! You wanna be somebody?\nSee somebody? Try and free somebody?\nGot a list of demands written on the palm of my hands\nI ball my fist and you're gonna know where I stand\nWe're living hand to mouth\nHand to mouthEmbed"
