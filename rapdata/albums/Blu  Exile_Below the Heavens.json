Come on\nUh, turn it up (Yeah)\nI'm tryna tell my folks that flowing ain't easy\nIt ain't easy to jock, for real, yo\n\n[Verse 1]\nPicture me sitting in front of eighty-eight keys tryna escape\nFrom a shady place where babies blaze trees on a daily day\nTryna get they gravy straight to floss, Co$$ told me, \"Homie watch it\nThese ladies play dirty games once you get to grinding\"\nWhere niggas pitch as quick as Nolan Ryan\nHolding iron, blowing smoke, elope in fire, flame spitting\nThe game is just a way to escape\nAnd our pain is just a way we can relate to folks crying\nFinding ways I can make a difference, but fuck wishing on a star\nCause the percentage of getting what you envisioned is small\nAnd the stars barely shine in the city, so we're blinded\nBy the man-made bright lights, making my eyes shifty\nFeel me out, hear me now, crying childs of the ghetto\nLetting go a beautiful sound, it's kinda falsetto\nHello Hell, welcome to L.A. where devils that dwell play\nThey meddle with metal and letting every shell spray\nUntil day dawns, I make songs for the long road travelers\nAnd lost souls after us\nSpitting lyrics vicious like I\u2019m mad as fuck\nPacking up my bags, hopping back on the narrow path that\u2019s planned for us\n[Chorus]\nI'm tryna tell my folks that flowing ain't easy\nTraveling down this yellow brick road until it frees me\nI need a pen, I need a pad, I need a place to go\nTo get this shit lifted off of my soul\nI'm tryna tell my folks that flowing ain't easy\nTraveling down this yellow brick road until it frees me\nI need a pen, I need a pad, I need a place to go\nTo get this shit lifted off of my soul\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, in this world that I'm living in\nI've given into sex, stress, and dividends\nLos Angeles, metropolis, city of vexed citizens\nFolks that smoke infinite dope and hope living in\nPoverty is probably the less stressed position to go\nSo we don\u2019t have positions to hold\nSo we pitch snow and live in the cold\nIn Hell inhaling, feeling Heaven is close\nBut like roadkill, I'm still on this road\nBold as any soldier playing his role\nI stroll the streets in the cold, even in summer heat, it gets cold\nSo we strolling with the heat and it's cold\nIt\u2019s been a long troublesome road and I'm still traveling\nAnd fuck battling, just managing, life is challenging\nThough I managed to make it, I damaged the places\nUp in my mind, life and times of Los Angeles' greatest\nWasting time, wasting lifespans fucking around\nI'm spitting deep shit stuck underground\nSo just dig it or don't fuck with it\nOr don't fuck with it\nBecause you can't fuck with it, uh, uh\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nI'm tryna tell my folks that flowing ain't easy\nTraveling down this yellow brick road until it frees me\nI need a pen, I need a pad, I need a place to go\nTo get this shit lifted off of my soul\nI'm tryna tell my folks that flowing ain't easy\nTraveling down this yellow brick road until it frees me\nI need a pen, I need a pad, I need a place to go\nTo get this shit lifted off of my soul\n\n[Verse 3]\nCheck it, and I'll be playing Escapism by Pete Rock\nHot, watching police plot knocks to get my peeps locked\nSmiling as my teeth rot from eating sugar coated quotes\nSmoking dope to float away, but hey, the air is nice up there\nI swear the feeling's good as chilling with a nice cold beer\nWe fallen angels rocking halos like it's priced up gear\nAnd if you need me, just ring me, shit I'll be right up here\nWhere fear is non-existent (Yeah)\nInstead of drifting in a prison where my mind's restricted\nWhere my mom is wishing, tryna get her broken promise mended\nI'm training to be a seamstress, sewing holes that dreams fit\nFiends bring broken clocks, tryna get their dreams fixed\nTicking, itching, tocking, watching, God is watching you\nBut you rather have a watch with lots of diamonds, I've been fooled\nBy the word a few times, but who cares if Blu rhymes\nAbout hoes or saving souls? They wanna hear that beat ride\nI rewind and try to play back the days when they would play stacks\nOf 8-tracks to recline, now we blaze sacks\nTaking back the feeling hidden in me when we used to smile\n'Member that? It's been a while, so I'm blowing off the dust\nBrush the dirt up off my nuts, got this feeling in my gut\nI'm tryna let it out, so if you with me, listen up\nListen, listen up, if you with me, listen up\n'Cause uh, I got this feeling in my gut, what the fuck?\n[Chorus]\nI'm tryna tell my folks that flowing ain't easy\nTraveling down this yellow brick road until it frees me\nI need a pen, I need a pad, I need a place to go\nTo get this shit lifted off of my soul\nI'm tryna tell my folks that flowing ain't easy\nTraveling down this yellow brick road until it frees me\nI need a pen, I need a pad, I need a place to go\nTo get this shit lifted off of my soul\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, uh, what up, X?\nUh, B, the Liberty Project, make money\nI wanna send one out to the hometown: Bridgetown!\nYeah, DS, Aloe Blacc\nCassius King, Donnie Smokes, Don Ox\n[?] life, Rocksteady [?]\nAnd all my folks, K-M to the A-M (Dirty Science)\nOnce again, yeah\nFrom the S-I-C to y'all, come on\nUh, yeah, Los Angeles10Embed"

One minute you a baby and the next\nYou sexin' without protection and now you holdin' a baby like\nDamn, I was just in your shoes\nNow you the papa that's adjustin' they shoes\nTeach them to walk straight\nCause honestly, they got a long way to go\nAnd what you tell 'em now is all that they know\nSee I remember when my folks said\n\"You'll know what I mean when you get older\"\nI was only a teen, thinking that I was a grown-up\nPlease, I had so much to see\nThinking the little that I saw was all the world had to offer to me\nAt 18, I headed off in the streets without guidance\nJust the eyes of God watching over me it's time\nI spent hours working nine-to-fives to survive\nMe and Jack up in the shack started hustlin' sacks\nJust to eat chips and soda\nThinking we finna blow up once this demo gets done\nWe gon be stretched out rich, riding limos and such\nBoy, I was just a dreamer\nRocking shows like I went gold, you shoulda seen us\nWe was full of youth, not yet abused by time\nIt's like I saw the whole world through my rhymes\nIt's kinda crazy, right? (How time flies)\n[Chorus]\nTwenty-two years ago to keep it on track\nNo time, time, time, time, time for looking back\nTwenty-two years ago to keep it on track\nFuck it black, no time, time, time, time, time for looking back\nBut only you saw what took too many time to see\n\n[Verse 2: Blu]\nThis reminds me of junior high, when you and I first met\n'96 was a year that I could never forget\nSunset summer school dance, kisses chicken heads\nSpreadin rumors, \"Blu's cheatin' on Shameka with Anika\"\nWe was bad, ditching class, grass had us all gassed\nI never smoked, played ball, thought it would make me choke\nBy the way we lost the championship game by one\nSlow fucker hit a three at the buzzer\nMy heart sunk, I started crying, I was tryna be a pro-baller\nMy first fuck was that year and still I don't call her\nMy own father brought me to her house that weekend\nHe was cheating so I lost my big V while he was beatin\nIn the other room, not yet abused by time\nI saw the whole world through that girl's eyes\nIt's kinda crazy though (How time flies) how it flies\nMy grandpa died the same year\nMy mom thought that I was too young to make this song\nBecause I'm only 22, but John Barnes has a long path behind him\nI'm walkin in the shoes of a giant\nAnd I was a fan of Jordan way before I knew Bryant\nLost my great grey suit but I was through crying\nSo I hear tears behind my suit and tie and\nNow you can find it through my rhymin' cause my timing has come\nAnd you gon know my whole story by the time I get done\nRising like the shining sun, reminding you how we came\nWe rich now, but used to be slaves\nWe pushing whips now, we used to be whipped\nRockin chains when we used to be in 'em\nStill complaining that we victims in the system\nShit is twisted but shit, we came a long ass way\nYet it just feels like one long day\nShit amazes me (How time flies)\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nTwenty-two years ago to keep it on track\nNo time, time, time, time, time for looking back\nTwenty-two years ago to keep it on track\nFuck it black, no time, time, time, time, time for looking back\nBut only you saw what took too many time to see5Embed"

Ladies\nBut y'all be fronting and shit (for real)\nY'all be acting like y'all don't want me to work\nAnd then when I don't work, y'all act like\nI don't do enough work\nI need more cheese, and I need this\nAnd you need that, fuck that!\nBut hey, don't take it personal\n\n[Chorus]\nPlease don't take it personal\nBut I gotta go and work some more\nAnd I know deep down it hurt your soul\nBut I'm a blue collar worker, girl\nSo please don't take it personal\nBut I gotta go and work some more\nAnd I know deep down it hurt your soul\nBut I'm a blue collar worker, girl1Embed"

    "lyrics": "Dancing in the Rain Lyrics[Verse 1]\nLook, it's six o'clock, I'm hoppin' outta the bed\nRain fallin', callin' X, but my phone line's dead\nI guess my bills ain't paid, no ride to work for the day\nSecond option, hop the bus, but there's a traffic delay\nMy boss trippin', \u2018cause I'm runnin' late and ain't no excuse\nWhen I'm about to be 22 without a whip I could swoop\nFeel like I'm finna shoot my own dome with chrome to escape\nZonin' out \u2018cause working-working out ain't worth what I make\nMy lady callin' buggin', always fussin'\nJust because we ain't ballin'\nBut it's hard because her cousin's fuckin' rich\n\u2018Cause her husband's hustlin'\nAnd I ain't fuckin' touchin' nothin' but a mic\nFive o'clock and off the work, ready to go home and write\nBut I ain't got a buck to catch the bus, chillin' at the stop\nRain fallin' hard as ever and it's soakin' my socks\nFuck it! Kicked my kicks off and took off my jacket\nRolled my jeans up, beat up in my headphones blastin'\nBlazed some weed up and started laughin'\nWhile I'm splashin' in puddles\nLike, \"Mothafuck a struggle! We dancing in the rain.\"\n[Chorus]\nDon't nobody wanna dance slow in the rain\nJust move your ass, just move your ass\nDon't nobody wanna liberate the weight of the pain\nJust move your ass, just move your ass\n\n[Verse 2]\nSometimes I hate taking trips to the lab\nGot my pen and pad bookin' instrumentals in smash\nCatch the bus regardless, trying hard to be an artist\nBut my A&R be callin' me out my zone into his office\nBeing cautious, \u2018cause he don't want my record to brick\nAsking me how I think my projects progressin' and shit\nI said \"Cool,\" but the truth is I'm stressin' to grip\n\u2018Cause it's hard to make music when this depression exists\nThey say \"Use it as inspiration; the best of them did.\"\nWell, that's them, see, I can't handle this pressure for shit\nAnd if you ask me, stress is a bitch\nMy girl needs more attention\nAnd my record label's desperate for hits\nNow I'm pissed, \u2018cause I'm getting out the zone again\nMakes me start to dread when I see a microphone and shit\nIt ain't supposed to be like that, I said I'll be right back\nI left the office, got a phone, and called my partner Jac\nAnd I asked him: \"Remind me why I'm rappin'.\"\nAnd right before he answered I remembered my passion\nIn the past, when I was scribblin' in my tablet\nTo box out my mom and dad scrappin'\nTo help me when my grandmother passed\nPlus the many times when I was homeless\nAnd the times when I was broke\nAnd this music made a way when I was hopeless\nHe told me to remember the rain, it'll diminish the pain\nAnd he told me not to ask him again, \u2018cause I know\u2026\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nDon't nobody wanna dance slow in the rain\nJust move your ass, just move your ass\nDon't nobody wanna liberate the weight of the pain\nJust move your ass, just move your ass\nDon't nobody wanna dance slow in the rain\nJust move your ass, just move your ass\nDon't nobody wanna liberate the weight of the pain\nJust move your ass, just move your ass\n\n[Bridge]\nDon't nobody wanna liberate the weight of the pain\nJust move your ass, just move your ass\nDon't nobody wanna\nDon't nobody wanna\nDon't nobody wanna\nDance \u2013 slow \u2013 in the \u2013 rain\nDon't nobody wanna\nDon't nobody wanna\n\n[Chorus]\nDon't nobody wanna dance slow in the rain\nJust move your ass, just move your ass\nDon't nobody wanna liberate the weight of the pain\nJust move your ass, just move your ass12Embed"

It's young Blu\nAnd you are? Okay\nI'd like to get to know you if it's okay\nAyo, tell me what I'm s'posed to do\nAyo, tell me what I'm s'posed to do\nFirst things first\nYou gotta tell me what I'm s'posed to do\nLet me know just what I'm s'posed to do\nFirst things first\nMy name is... It's young Blu\nAnd you are? Okay\nI'd like to get to know you if it's okay\n[Verse 1: Blu]\nSee it's so many ways I can approach you\nI can either start off like, ''scuse me miss', but shit that's too old school\nAnd I can flow to you but that's too cliche\nPlus I don't bust to bust nuts, I bust over beat breaks\nI could be honest with you and tell you I'm a cheapskate\nBut, you probably seen me sharing drinks with my DJ\nSo, fronting like I got chips is out the question\nAnd acting like my Benz is in the shop is outdated\nAnd I ain't into playing games\nPlus I already hate them fake ballers that be always dropping names\nAnd yeah I'm in the game but if I say I rap\nYou'll be looking for my range, gold chains and my strap\nAnd I can act conscious, but if we talk politics\nYou'll notice that I'm out of the loop, 'cause I don't follow it\nI rock fitted caps, kufis ain't for Blu, see\nI eat red meat 'cause tofu don't move me\nAnd women are confusing, but that's for later on\nAnd the only way to tell you is to say it in these songs\nLike darling you a doll, don't confuse it with sexual\nBut don't think, I don't think of having sex with you\nI'm trying to get next to you, but you being rude\nIn the club with ya guns out, shooting down fools\nShe shot down one, and shot down two\nNow tell me what the fuck am I supposed to do\nYou might also like[Chorus: Miguel & Blu]\nFirst things first\nAin't tryna game you up so girl I'll be straight\nFirst things first\nDon't want to mess it up before it's too late\nFirst things first\nMy name is... It's young Blu\nAnd you are? Okay\nI'd like to get to know you if it's okay\nAyo, tell me what I'm s'posed to do\nAyo, tell me what I'm s'posed to do\nFirst things first\nYou gotta tell me what I'm s'posed to do\nLet me know just what I'm s'posed to do\nFirst things first\nMy name is... It's young Blu\nAnd you are? Okay\nI'd like to get to know you if it's okay\n\n[Verse 2: Blu]\nNow, don't get it twisted broke niggas need love too\nAnd underground rappers like to chill at the club too\nI wanna get buzzed, get drunk and get crunk\nGet a chick to kick it with when I'm feeling fucked up but\nWomen be mentioning ya' whips and your chains\nSo I flip it like slaves come with whips and chains, we gotta liberate\nBut before I could mention my name\nThey be talking to the nigga with the keys to the Range\nAnd I can't even compete with these ballers trying to get at you\n'Cause I ain't even got enough cheese to try to match dude\nNor do I got a flat to bring you back to\nBut, I can roll up a blunt and try to relax you\nProbably make you laugh when you mad in a bad mood\nAnd ask a few questions 'bout caressing your statue\n'Cause no, I ain't got corn rows or hood tattoos\nBut, I can fuck up any track that I rap too\nI, know it's irrelevant, but rap is my profession\nAnd just cause I'm a gentleman, don't mean I'm into settling\nI spend most my time on the grind, but I ain't peddling rocks\nOr trying to sign to the Roc, I'm trying to meddle in my own business\nSo tell your girls mind they own business\nAnd I would give you my digits but see my phone isn't Accepting calls 'til the bills get paid\nNow you say you want the real, but it's the real I'm saying. So what the deal?\n[Chorus: Miguel & Blu]\nFirst things first\nAin't tryna game you up so girl I'll be straight\nFirst things first\nDon't want to mess it up before it's too late\nFirst things first\nMy name is... It's young Blu\nAnd you are? Okay\nI'd like to get to know you if it's okay\nIf it's okay with you\nIf it's okay with you...9Embed"

Trained'a snatch 'em\nYou flashin' in the Range? You waitin' for an accident to happen on purpose\nCadillac verses\nSun-roofed diamond-back rap, that's the verdict, nigga5Embed"
