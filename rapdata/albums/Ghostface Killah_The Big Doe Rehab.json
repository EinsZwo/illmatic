The Barrel Brothers Lyrics[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]\nYo, straight out the ghetto, I'm damn hood\nI stack a dollar like a whole rack of canned goods\nBaggy jeans, no Timbs, ACG boots\nLivin' in the crack spot, bangin' that Sheek Louch\nThe narcotics is far from garbage\nWhether it's cold or it's late August\nMy shit is fresh cuz I catch the hottest\nMy little cousin bubble swatches and carry a couple oxes\nKeep a deuce deuce by his ankle and get it poppin'\nYou know, we be the boys clockin' the graveyard shift\nBig bubbles, countin' the cream, burnin' the lazar spliff\nMy man jumps out the whip with the AR 5th\nAnd we ball from plenties of parties, 'cause we start shit\nParole holes, six months in the box\nMy little sister got her head shaved off\nShe made it home from shock\nWe sellin cartons, Pampers, Similac formula\nAnything you take because the paper keep callin ya\nGangsters keep ballin fosho, we want more\nWe make it rain from the tech and the wop\nThe next coroner priests don't have enough cups for us\nTo slow us up, they hit us with dusk\nThen they rush-bust, my man Big Ron will break the cuffs\n300 pound nigga, po-po has to fuck him up\nThey say that my projects should undergo therapy\nWe never voted, we votin' for Oprah, Obama, and Eric B\n[Verse 2: Solomon Childs]\nGuns imported from Duval\nWheelchairs and shit bags\nPeach Snapples and pretty scalpels, renaissance\nI'll stick a pick in ya gut at the chapel\nI'll blow a nigga for a box of Huggies\nCop-killers with a box of dummies\nDummies, stuck to the project floors\nNiggas is suited up and we ready for war\n\n[Verse 3: Beanie Sigel]\nIt's the Broad Street Bully and the Killah with no Face\nMy mac bullets burn like tequila with no chase, yeah!\nMy knife work like the guillotine sword, cutting niggas\nStop frontin' for my killa bee swarm, something\nEmpty out the whole clip and reload\nShotgun barrel leave it smoking like a broke stove\nYeah, and I'm all about that bullshit\nThe casket, the hearse, and the pastor in the pulpit\nI kill a nigga at the drop of a dime\nJust imagine what I'd do for a quarter\nAin't no tellin what I'd do for a dollar\nPop a nigga right in front of his mama\nSon a nigga right in front of his daughter\nAnd I'm nothing like your father\nYou couldn't come from these nuts I got\nAnd C. Baltimore sucked this cock\nI know most of y'all wouldn't understand\nGet it? Understand?\nYeah some niggas will and some niggas won't\nLike some niggas kill and some niggas don't (uh-uh)\nYou's a fake-it-'til-you-make-it of nigga\nI'm a straight-up-take-it type of nigga\nPistol-whip-a-nigga-'til-I-break-it type of nigga\nI'm hard on chumps, most of these dudes is fags\nPut the guarder on pumps, push the broom up they ass\nOr the knife like American me, American Sig' is Muslim\nSo I ain't feelin Bush overseas\nI think with the wisdom of Malcolm, got the soul of a Panther\nSo by any means is the anthem\nYou gonna have to cut me out the track like cancer\nI can't stop, won't stop\nThis how we do it from Philly to ShaolinYou might also likeEmbed"

Don't go up in the spot\"\nJettin' through bushes and backyards, neighbors is rattin' me out\nDogs is barkin' all you hear is the car's sirens\nI'm tryin' to think and toss the iron\nBomb in my sweats got me runnin' funny, you think I'm lyin'\nMay God strike me if he don't like me, I'm tired and I'm out of breath\nThe weed got me paranoid, my heart's poundin' through my chest\nTryin' to focus up and make progress\nThat's what I get for slingin' in them projects\nNext thing you know I'm in this bitch's crib chillin'\nTold her my story and like this I had her legs in the ceiling\nCookin' me fries, fish sticks, hot side of them biscuits\nWhile she doin' this, the bitch still slidin' on lipstick\nNow I got the fat stomach on, she crackin' a dutch\nI'm playin' with her pussy on the couch, I'm ready to fuck\nLike come here miss lady wop, where you put the condom box?\nShe finished off the last one, oh shit I hear the cops\nHandcuffs and talkies, I mashed her white Yorkie\nJettin' up the stairs, them pigs want revenge like Porky's\nSo I slid, hid behind the wall, opened the door\nLike ooo I seen my man Meth goin' in raw\nSo he jumped up balls out, hid in the closet\nI'm dyin' laughin', he said \"Yo Starks be quiet!\"\n[Method Man]\n...and let me put my drawers on, nigga what kinda dope you on?\nShoulda knocked before you came in the spot, Ghost you wrong\nBustin' in here on that government shit\nGot this chick screamin' grabbin the sheets tryin' to cover her tits\nShe's asthmatic and you laughin' son\nI bump my toe on the nightstand just runnin tryna grab the gun\n'Cause shit's real man, you spazzin' dun\nThere comes a time in a man's life, he gotta toss his pack and run\nYou know we family like Crack and Pun\nBut Mr. GFK, state your business after that, be one\nNow can it be that you hot, lord?\nYou did some shit on the block that the cops tryna lock you for?\nCan't believe you blowin' the spot, lord\nMy chick is buggin', she trippin'\nMy dick keep slippin' out my boxer drawers\nNow I'm caught up in the drug sting\nNiggas is callin' my horn, police is hittin' every corner we on\nCan't understand it, it's a thug thing\nAnd in the middle of thought, I'm interrupted by Shallah Raekwon\n\n[Raekwon]\nI need my money Meth, gonna buy them hundred birds\nTell Tone get at me, all them little clients want work\nHe know we fresh out, tell the kid meet me, matter of fact beep me\nWord to mother lord, son he got me hurt\nYou still fuckin' shorty?

A Dill pickle\n(Not that) Oh, that's the .45 stainless nickel\nI'm pullin' a green, got a G for the biggest ass on the floor who look right in them jeans\nIf you fat, I might take one for the team\nBut I gotta get drunk first, know what I mean? Come on!\n\n[Hook 3: Ghostface Killah + (Rare Earth sample)]\n(I just want to celebrate)\nLike we won the Power Ball money\n(I just want to celebrate)\nTony Starks won an Oscar, y'all\n(I just want to celebrate)\nLike all of my goons just came home\n(I just want to celebrate)\nWe 'bout to have a good year\n[Verse 3: Ghostface Killah + (Cocoa Channelle)]\nNa-na-na-na-nah, you can't catch me\nI'm out like Thomas in a five-fifty\nPolice be fiending to frisk me\nI'm so legit I walk away with the car keys pissy\nBack at the labo, shorty wop need a Dutch\nHe fuckin' wit a Goose dick, tonight I'ma beat it up\nYour thing to wet, you sure you ain't seeded up?\n(That's how I get, Ghost, especially when you eat it up)\nMy goodness gracious, ass is flirtatious\nMove it around like a snake miss or sexy waitress\nGhost don't have no patience\nI like you, I usually change chicks like radio stations\nI'm definitely not looking for love\nBut if you give it to me right now I might say I was\nYou can chill if you want, I got crazy bud\nBut before we do, what it do, go jump in the tub; come on!\n\n[Hook 4: Trife Da God + (Rare Earth sample)]\n(I just want to celebrate)\nThrow your hands up, nigga\n(I just want to celebrate)\nPop the 'pagne, pop the cork\n(I just want to celebrate)\nRepresentin' on the streets of New York\n(I just want to celebrate)\n{Ghostface} We 'bout to have a good year\n\n[Outro: Kid Capri]\nYeah, we gets it in, gets it in, gets it in\nNew York, we been had it, we gets it in\nOutta town we fuckin' up but gets it in\nWorldwide we doin', we gets it in\nThe Ghostface, Kid Capri, I gets it in\nThat's no joke, when we here, we get it in\nNo kiddin', in the building\nGetting it in, all day, getting it in...Embed"

I don't know, I just don't feel right\nHavin' flashbacks, bugged out, man, knahmean?\nNah, I don't wanna go to the clinic, I don't want the hospital, son\nYou know, I just feel like I'm lost, reality, man, y'knahmean?\nMy face feels numb, son\n\n[Hook]\nYou might also like[Ghostface Killah]\nFlashbacks to me blowin' his brains out\nAll I remember's my shirt, I couldn't get them goddamned stains out\nOxy cleans weak 'round the chest area\nRighthand side, I'm pluckin' off li'l pieces of meat\nAnd my goons want me to bounce to Tennessee\nBut I said no, I got these two snow-bunnies in Venice Beach\nOn the low, son, I sleep with the hawk, in East New York\n'Round my man Killa' way where all the murderers walk\nManhunt, police searches, swat ran in my crib\nBattering rams, early mornin', yo, waking my kids\nNow my aunt gotta stay wit' my wiz\nShe paranoid, havin' anxiety attacks cause of these pigs\nPlus my connect, they goin' crazy, they try'na slay me\nI told 'em, Friday I'll have they money, faggots try'na play me\nI'll never eat up out a garbage can\nI'll Larry Davis a cop, and if I make it alive, it was the Father's plan\n\n[Outro 1 {*outro 2 plays along with outro 1*}]\nI ain't goin' nowhere, I ain't goin' nowwhere, I'm aight, I'm aight\nBut I know one thing, if anybody touch me, I'm blowin' they head smooth off\nCops, connects, I don't give a fuck, they gon' feel that Eagle, they gon' feel that Desert\nThey gon' feel that Bulldog, y'knahmean? I don't give a fuck\nDon't put me in no mental clinics, it ain't nothin', y'knahmean?\nIf I make it out alive, I make it out alive, if not, fuck it\nYo, I can't take this shit no more, it's too hype\nNiggas thinkin' I'm buggin' out, I ain't buggin'\nY'all niggas'd be buggin' out too if you had somebody's flesh on you\nMotherfuckers, fuck ya'll niggas, I ain't goin' crazy\nSleepin' on couches and shit... I'm goin' back outside, fuck ya'll niggas, man\n[Outro 2]\nI walk around acting strange, like a man in a daze\nPeople talking to me and calling my name\nBut I don't hear a word they say\nI walk around acting strange, like a man in a daze\nPeople talking to me and calling my name\nBut I don't hear a word they say\nI know my Mother's worried about me\nCause they might have to put me away at any time\nCause when my baby packed up her clothes and left me\nShe oh!
