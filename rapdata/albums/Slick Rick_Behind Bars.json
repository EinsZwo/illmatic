Mission Impossible\nBecause she's the one the hon chose to boast to\nThe way that her and the bitch is so close to be a waste\nSo make music in my basement\nDon't cut her off until I find a good replacement\nOne day I jumped in my Jeep, drove her to her friend's\nHouse, cause the hon was sleeping over\nMy girl was acting fine, then the slime switched\nWanna diss, I said \"It's over, you waste of time bitch\"\nTried to kiss her friend, twice then a third\nShe said \"Stop, Rick\", but didn't tell her friend a word\nI went to bed, here come my girl touching me tenderly\nSnuck out later, girlfriend wasn't acting as friendly as before\nBecause she swore a nigga hit her\n\"Well if you ain't love her why'd you go back to bed with her?\"\nBut I didn't (no you ain't), now the hon badgering\nI don't know, maybe it's me, maybe I'm imagining the love affair\n[Bridge]\nGot Rick sitting right here\nWaiting for you my dear\nWondering if you're ever gonna show, you ho\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnother brother out for one thing, mistook him for\nSteady relationship is what I'm really looking for\nSincerity, scoop the hon I done it\nI said \"Being straight up, you I really wanted\"\nThough she fucked niggas with money like mad\nStill found myself wanting the honey quite bad\nLoyal to her friend, though she knew she wanted wood\nThen we did it, boy that pussy was good\n\"But what if shorty finds out?\" Never be too clever\n\"Rick, she has to know if we're to ever be together\"\nChill, then we started to button the strap and\nWhen my girl woke up, we acted like ain't nothing happened\nLater on, my girlfriend stormed in\n\"We going to the supper club, some kid's performing\nBye, see you later\"\nHer girlfriend hot, let me see how they livin', Rick decide to follow\nI'm outside of the club sipping a beer through the best can\nBoth sluts were sliding numbers to the next man\nContradicting of words being together\nMy girl, too, I should've known, birds of a feather\nBack in my Jeep, about 4:11\nPopped another can, looked up to the heavens\nI'm a good man, in fact I know that I am\nAnd I deserve a lady love, that's why I'm wondering why I'm\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nSitting in my car, waiting for you-ooh-ooh, lalalala\n\n[Bridge]\nGot Rick sitting right here\nWaiting for you my dear\nWondering if you're ever gonna show, you ho\n\n[Chorus]\nSomething tells Rick he's a fool\nTo let girls treat me so cruel\nBut never-the-less, Rick said \"You got me waiting\"\nSitting in my car, waiting for you-ooh-ooh, lalalala3Embed"

(Okay, daddy, I understand your [?])\nCause bitches ain't no good, you know what I'm sayin?\n(Okay, I get your point) Anyway, listen to this, check it out\n\n[Verse 1]\n1994, as the world gets trifer\nI'm wondering, fuck I need a woman in my life for?\nYa know, cause it's like a nigga whole history\nWith you hoes been nothing but misery\nFirst rater, five-one stood\nMad coke fiend though the bitch looked good\nMet her at the Fever, \"What's going on, stranger?\"\nAnd like a fool took her in and tried to change her\nI don't who I thought I's bluffing\nThat bitch wasn't giving up that coke for nothing\n\"Oh you tryna dis, mister bougeois nigga\nYet back in the day, you used to smoke coke cigarettes too\nThat type shit you ain't admitting\"\nBecause, home girl, I grew out of it, you didn't\nAnyway, dead outta order\nCame in with a sheepskin her ex-lover bought her\nWho gave you that? \"My ex\" I said \"Who?\"\nBelieve she had the nerve to say \"You can wear it too\"\nWhen I found strength to depart, I do\nWithdrew, for something brand new\n[Hook]\nSomeone who would be true\nYes, I should find someone who would be true\nCause Ricky needs a love that's true, true\nOh dear, Scooby Dooby Doo..\n\n[Verse 2]\nThen I met Syb, sweating the viking\nA brown skinned fox, slim just like I like 'em\n\"What? Sweating you? Picture that, nerd.. please\"\nAnyway, the bitch had herpes!\nYou know, imagine me, the fool being the spouse\nDoctor said I couldn't catch it 'less I got aroused\nFound out snooping in her bag what she got\nNow why you ain't tell me? You worthless slut!\n\"Because I loved you at the time and couldn't afford to\"\nYou know homegirl should get the Oscar award for her lying\nAnyway, stayed with the creep\nOne day, Sybil here, talking in her sleep\n\"Chris, wait,\" the bum bitch said\nSo loud 'til a mothafucka fell out the bed\nWho the hell is Chris? She putting up resistance\n'til I caught her calling the nigga long distance\nHad the nerve to dispatch loving\nBoy am I lucky that I didn't catch nothing\nWhen I found strength to depart, I do\nWithdrew, for something brand new\nYou might also like[Hook]\nSomeone who would be true\nYes, I should find someone who would be true\nCause Ricky needs a love that's true, true, true\nIndeed, I need a love that's true\nIt seems I need a love that's true\nOh dear, Scooby Dooby Doo\nOh gosh, Scooby Dooby Doo\n\n[Verse 3]\nThough happy I was free, the need for love was still in me\nGot to the point like the need for it was killing me\nThen I met shorty here, hanging with my cousin\nFound out later how young the bitch was and\nThough I done hit it and she opened up a world\nAnd remind me of that song \"Go Away, Little Girl\"\nIt had to end because the bitch weren't loyal, and spoiled\n\"That's because I had you pussy whipped royal\"\nYou see the type of shit a nigga was gonna marry?\nYou see the type of attitude the bum bitch carry?\nLike oil and water, impossible mixture\nThen temper tantrums came into the picture\nYelling, carrying on bad and cursing\nComplete embarassment to the Ruler as a person\n\"Gimme shorts\" Ruler will not permit you\nThen she goes wild, starts breaking up my furniture\nFlirts too, excuse me, a whore\nLike the world's worst groupie when I brought her on tour\nSo when I found strength to depart, I do\nWithdrew, for something brand new\n[Hook]\nSomeone who would be true\nYes, I should find someone who would be true\nCause Ricky needs a love that's true, true, true\nIndeed, I need a love that's true\nIt seems I need a love that's true\nOh dear, Scooby Dooby Doo\nOh gosh, Scooby Dooby Doo1Embed"
