Let's go\n(One, two, three, four!)\nYo, yo, back in it, back in it\n\n[Sample]\n\"The one thing that, the black audience realized, is when the tower fell\nThere were some changes. There was a change in societies, where where\nAll of a sudden they went from being, somewhat of the people still having a say\nTo now it's, whatever the masses do. So there's not even really a choice\nThat a black audience is being given.\"\n[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]\nThey talk about us, not usin the word nigga\nI wanna speak about a couple issues much bigger\nLike most black folks live below the poverty line\nAnd they wonder why the FUCK we attracted to crime\nGot niggas shootin niggas at the drop of a dime\nBabies in the street die way before they time\nMany single parent mothers packin welfare lines\nAnd niggas bein donors, the apocalypse is on us\nNiggas take onus, that's all I ever asked\nAnd got pegged as a hater, man they tryin to take niggas\nOut with the fader, started with three\nDown to two-six later, back independent\nCause to kids I wouldn't cater\nGo against the system you in bed with Al'Qaeda\nDog they not playin\nLook here, they goin to war with more than rap\nThis our muh'fuckin lives now it's time to fight back\n\n[Hook: Carlitta Durand]\nThey're coming closer for you\nThey're gonna get you while you sleep, watch out!\nDon't sleep, beware\nThey're coming closer for you\nAnd they won't stop 'til you delete, watch out!\nDon't sleep, beware\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Phonte]\nYes sir, one time, uhh, uhh, yo\nI came back from NY, a nigga lost his deal\nFelt sick to the stomach, almost lost his meal\nLost friends from way back, and on top of all that\nThey tryin to blame this rap shit for all of our ills\nLike I can stick you up with a mic\nLike I can rape you with a verse or use a verb as a knife\nLike before Kool Herc, everything was alright\nLike y'all wasn't callin black women hoes befo' \"Rappers Delight\"\nSheeeit~! That's just idiot talk, this whole shit is a farce\nI refuse to be hip-hop's pallbearer\nHad to tell me son cut that bullshit off\nThem ain't videos nigga, that's psychological warfare\nToo many different variations of the same face\nDesigned to keep yo' broke ass in the same place\nSomethin else more yo it gots to be for\nI'mma end transmission cause they watchin me\nI know they watchin me\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Outro]\nYeah, do not attempt to adjust your station\nThere is nothing wrong, for we have takin over\nCome to give y'all the truth\nPhonte, Big Pooh, Illmind on the beat\nIt's time to wake 'em the fuck up yo\nYEAH~!\n[Hook] - as background music fades out1Embed"

Big fish in a little pond\nSwimmin 'round town, thinkin like we already stars\nAnd they say that money change you, but money don't change you\nIt just make you more of what you already are\nHope our kids do better than we\nHope he and she learn to stick together when the times get ugly\nI've been misconstrued, lied to and abused\nBut my fam still swear that they love me man\n[Hook: Phonte]\nIf this is love, I don't wanna see hate\nIf this is real, I don't wanna see fake, I'm sayin\nCause I don't know how much more I can take\nI know that all of y'all can relate, I'm sayin\nUhh, if this is love, I don't wanna see hate\nIf this is real, I don't wanna see fake\nYou know that ain't love love, that ain't love love\nThat ain't love love, that ain't love love\n\n[Verse 2: Rapper Big Pooh]\nYou were the, right hand, my man 50 Grand\nUs gettin dollars was all part of the plan\nA few years back we cut ties, you understand\nIt was all business, nuttin person-al\nAnd you vowed to come back a different person now\nWe are back on track, and time heals wounds\nNothin showed me you came back too soon\nYeah, once again you and I to the tune\nWe brought you on tour, put money in your fist\nYou fucked up plenty and got slapped on the wrist\nThat's it! And everytime the brothers grand mack\nThe topic would arise about you bein kept\nThe Lord says forgive I will never forget\nShoulda picked up the phone when the times got ugly\nI've been misconstrued, lied to and abused\nBut my fam still swear that they love me\nAww sheeit!\nYou might also like[Hook: Phonte & Rapper Big Pooh]\nIf this is love, I don't wanna see hate\nIf this is real, I don't wanna see fake, I'm sayin\nCause I don't know how much more I can take\nI know that all of y'all can relate, I'm sayin\nYeah, if this is love, I don't wanna see hate\nIf this is real, I don't wanna see fake\nYou know that ain't love love, that ain't love love\nThat ain't love love, that ain't love love\n\n[Verse 3: Jozeemo]\n\"I'ma ride for my niggas\", I figure that's what they all say\nIt's foul play when cuttin throats is your forte\nDo it how you wanna be done, that's what the Lord say\nDaps and hugs, but turn your back and get the swordplay\nI'm sure you say I got it all wrong, it ain't like that\nI sent you all them letters, guess it's better you ain't write back\nDespite the fact you told me plenty tears you had to fight back\nAll lies, surprise, I ain't diss you with no spite track\nI know you'd probably like that, but never will I hit your level\nYou gon' dig your own grave, focus when you grip the shovel\nI should be pissed as ever, but I'm the bigger brother\nSo I'mma keep it movin while you get your shit together\nOur bonds was severed, but all you had to say was fuck me\nI smelled your bullshit, consider me lucky\nI've been misconstrued, lied to and abused\nBut my fam still swear that they love me\nAin't that a bitch?!\n[Hook: Phonte & Jozeemo]\nIf this is love, I don't wanna see hate\nIf this is real, I don't wanna see fake, I'm sayin\nCause I don't know how much more I can take\nI know that all of y'all can relate, I'm sayin\nLet's go, if this is love, I don't wanna see hate\nIf this is real, I don't wanna see fake\nYou know that ain't love love, that ain't love love\nThat ain't love love, that ain't love love1Embed"

It's Phonte\nI got my man Big Pooh up here with me (Yeah!)\nIt's about 6 o'clock in the Chopp Shopp, man\nWe... y'know finally reachin' the end of this album and I just wanna thank y'all, like...\nI was never a big fan of doin' the whole long talk, monologue shit at the end of the album but...\nIn the light of all the shit that me and my nigga done been through in a couple, man like...\nI feel it's only right to show the love back to the people that's been supportin us and.. (It's only right) ynahmsayin?\nLike, people always ask us like \"Yo man, do y'all ever feel bad that, y'know you ain't gettin the shine y'all deserve\nYou ain't get this, you ain't get that..\"\nMan, I could be mad about a whole lotta shit but, at the end of the day you still here.. (Still here, baby!)\nYnahmsayin? We still doin our shit\nAnd it's like... it's like yo man..\nThe main thing we want y'all to take from this album\nYou don't take shit else from this record, man\nIf you don't get nothin else, man from the whole...\nThe whole story of Little Brother, man, just know that..\nWe just two niggas that did not quit, man, through whatever (Ever!) ALL the shit we done been through, dawg\nThese niggas never let up, man it's like.. (NEVER!)\nThat's just life, dawg youknahmsayin? You gotta get up..\nYou gotta keep doin ya thang, youknahmean? (STILL HERE, BABY!)\nKeep it movin... Let's go!\n[Hook: Phonte]\nWhen everything is young, fresh and neeeeeeeeeeww\nWhen everything is young, fresh and neeeeeeeeeeww, ooh-ooh\n\n[Interlude: Phonte]\n(Well)\nAnother morning, (wake up wake up) as the night fades away\nI wish she would stay for awhiiiile (for awhile)\nAnother warning, (wake up wake up) not to waste all our days (waste all our days)\nSo let's greet today with a smile (Smiii-iiii-iii-iile...)\n\n[Hook: Phonte]\nWhen everything is young, fresh and neeeeeeeeeeww\nUh, when everything is young, fresh and neeeeeeeeeeww, ooh-ooh\n\n[Verse 1: Rapper Big Pooh]\nUh, I know it sounds like an ending, this is a beginning\nThe wheels keep spinnin' on a brand new thought\nAnd people all the time sayin Rapper Pooh ought\nTo go back to school, stop playin cool\nWe'll stop by the pool, no shame belly showin'\nHate motivate last time to keep flowin'\nThat was last time, I evolved as a man\nAnd as I got older, I begin to understand\nThat dreams do change, goals rearranged\nIt's no longer fame I aspire to attain\nCause fame is a drain where your morals get flushed\nValues get crushed and we no longer trust\nWhat got us here in the first place, for me it only takes one case\nThe verdict's been read, these words been said now I K-I-M\nIt's plenty people left who believin in them (WORD?)\nAnd this here's the next chapter in my life\nAn ongoing saga I decided to write\nI decided it's right, you decide if you like\nYou decide that you like, God bless and goodnight!\nYou might also like[Hook: Phonte]\nWhen everything is young, fresh and neeeeeeeeeeww, ooh\nWhen everything is young, fresh and neeeeeeeeeeww, ooh-ooh\n\n[Verse 2: Phonte]\nPeace to my nigga Jozeemo\nAnd we gon Keep it Movin like Soul II Soul\nTay raps is the coldest, even though I feel\nLike the oldest 28-year-old I know\nRemember back in the days on the GTA\nWhen me and Aunt Gilles used the bus pass\nNow I go out on the road, come home, see my kids like\n\"Damn nigga, when you get a moustache?\"\nIn '98, lost my stepfather\nAround the same time that I met my partner\nGoin round campus as the shit starters\nGod damn! Time passes like Brett Favre\nAnd if you try to catch up, then don't even bother\nThat's why I can't do the shit I used to do no mo'\nThis world'll try to break you with lies and fables\nMake you not even believe in you no mo'\nHad to get back to me, get back to mines\nGet back to fam, get back to rhymes\nLay down at night and say without shame\nToday I was a man, tomorrow I'll be the same\nBe a bonfire when others are just a flame\nBe a memory when others are just a name\nThat's real words from a true heart\nYou can take it as a old ending or a new start\nWhatchu thought, Uh!\n\n[Interlude: Phonte]\nFeel brand neeeeeeeww\nAnd I'm just so happy to say\nFeel brand neeeeeeeww..\nJust so happy to seeeeeee\nFeel brand neeeeeeeww\nEmbrace another day to see the sun, brand neeeeeeeww\n\nUh, eh-heh\nIt's bout to be Friday morning joint, dawg\nOne more time, yeah\n\n[Hook: Phonte]\nWhen everything is young, fresh and neeeeeeeeeeww, ooh\nWhen everything is young, fresh and neeeeeeeeeeww, ooh-ooh\n\n[Outro: Phonte]\nRaise it upEmbed"

Shit was whack as hell\nWe was ready for +The Big Throwdown+ like Le-vert\nMe, Pooh, 9th, I.D., and Malachi\nIn the crowded-ass van filled with ugly-ass T-shirts\nDealin with the label drove Tiggalo bizzerk\nSo when we got home, I put my foot on the flo'\nSaid, \"I ain't doin this management shit no mo'\"\nGave the call to my nigga Big Dho, let's get it\nWe started makin money doin some travelin\nBut at home, my family life was steady unravelin\nMe and ol' girl wasn't seein eye to eye\nJust shackin up, layin thigh to thigh\nNot in love, just +Fakin Jax+ like InI\nShe said, \"Baby, you know I'll go through the wall for you\"\nBut when I stepped off the plane back from Portugal\nShe was gone - fuck it, y'all niggas heard \"All For You\"\nCame back to the crib, had to pack all my shit up\nCause that's when we did our first tour with Hiero\nSeem like everyday them niggas stay high tho'\nI love y'all, thanks for teachin us how to grind, yo\nCame off the road with my name well-respected\nHit the studio, me and Nic finished \"Connected\"\nMoney in my pocket and a new apartment\nAnd on top of that - now the major labels is watchin\nHeeeey! It was the top of '04\nAnd everythang seem to be movin in slo-mo\nNiggas wanted a deal so bad, they can taste it\nBut everyday, it seem like it would be a no-go\nWith a palm that's sweaty and hand that's jittery\nSigned, to Atlantic and the rest is misery\nOops! - Freudian slip, I mean the rest is history\nI\"m just still a little hot, excuse my niggery\nIn the middle of makin \"The Minstrel Show\"\nWe was out one night, saw this thang that caught my eye\nI like the way that she danced, like the way that she moved\nFly conversation and the way she thought was fly\nShe moved in and we got real close\nAnd I can see that she was way above av-erage\nSo we tied the knot, and my second son dropped\nAbout, six weeks after the album did\nY'all niggas know the rest, I won't bore you widdit\n\"Minstrel Show\" came and went; we went to war with critics\nThey said, \"We wouldn't make it as a two-man team\"\nBut this is part of a two-man dream\nThat I had in my heart since I walked out the store\nThat's what I did with my next day, whatchu gon' do with YOURS?\nWhatchu gon' do with YOURS?\n...and that's what hap'n, peace!You might also likeEmbed"
