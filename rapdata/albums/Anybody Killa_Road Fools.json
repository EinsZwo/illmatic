Someone help me, someone tell me\nWhy do I feel this way? Or is it all just built in my head?\nWhy do I feel this way? Someone help me, someone tell me\nWhy do I feel this way? Or is it all just built in my head?\nI try to focus and just handle things that come my way\nDon't let shit get to me 'cause there will always be another day\nMaintain my emotions if I don't then I'll be sure to fall\nAnd I'll be damned to let myself desaulve. So you better get used to me\n\nWhy do I feel this way? Someone help me, someone tell me\nWhy do I feel this way? Or is it all just built in my head?\nWhy do I feel this way? Someone help me, someone tell me\nWhy do I feel this way? Or is it all just built in my head?\n\nThese nights are getting shorter, this ride is seeming longer\nWhen will it end? Even though I really don't want it to\nThese nights are getting shorter, this ride is seeming longer\nWhen will it end? Even though I really don't want it to\n\nThese nights are getting shorter, this ride is seeming longer\nWhen will it end? Even though I really don't want it to\nThese night are getting shorter, this ride is seeming longer\nWhen will it end? Even though I really don't want it to\n\nWhy do I feel this way?

Hey, something's lurking, staring right at you\nI can feel your souls been waiting to let all my spirits through\nSo many faces on my spin\nWords I write, remembering\nAll these legends that we speak\nStories told, draw minds in deep\nWho can face the blackest cloud\nWhen lightening strikes on solid ground\nWho will be left, to see the mist\nOf afterlife, and happiness\nUp my sleeve, there's so many things\nWho knows what this killer brings?\nHypnotized, inside your mind\nBut still you can't see me\n(Chorus)\nHere I go again, another check\nNobody knows what the fuck I'm after\nNow you see me now you can't, disappear\nWhy you think ABK is so weird?\nBut fuck that, I got warrior skills!\nI can vanish like that, *snap* for real!\nSwoosh Gone! Like a dollar bill\nI'll have you're ass shiverin' with chills\n\n(Break)\nI'm a psycho, going crazy can't seem to get my head straight\nI'll these visions, I keep havin', want to take my breath away\nNon-believers stay alert because this world keeps changing\nUp my sleeve's a remedy, to keep you from decaying\n\n(Chorus)\n(Break)\nI'm a psycho, going crazy can't seem to get my head straight\n(CAN'T GET MY HEAD STRAIGHT)\nI'll these visions I keep havin', want to take my breath away\n(TAKE MY BREATH AWAY)\nNon-believers stay alert because this world keeps changing\n(THIS WORLD KEEPS CHANGING)\nUp my sleeve's a remedy, to keep you from decaying\n(Keep you from decaying...)You might also likeEmbed"

I got this urge to rock a show\nDamn near everywhere I go\nAre we there yet? I got this urge to rock a show\nDamn near everywhere I go\nAre we there yet? I got this urge to rock a show\nDamn near everywhere I go\nAre we there yet? I got this urge to rock a show\nDamn near everywhere I go\n\n(Break)(x2)\nI can't take this, are we there yet?\nPut the pedal to the metal, and let's ride!\n\nWe on these crazy highways, smoke away the night before\nConversating about when we come back, it's got to be just as dope\nOh the party in the parking lots, on the streets up by the beaches\nIt takes so much time to get there, I always have the urge to speak\n\n(Chorus)\nBoogie nights, doing it right\nUp till the sun comes up so who's driving?\n\nAll I know is that you better pay attention\nThere might be something, you're missing\nSo keep your eyes wide open\nAnd look out for something weird\nYou might also like(talking)Embed"
