    "lyrics": "Coldest Summer Ever Lyrics[Intro]\nYes, sir\nThis is another gangsta tale\nOne of them ones that I tell so well, for sho'\nI mean, I've been deemed to be the coldest storyteller ever\nAnd this is why\nCheck this out\n\n[Verse 1]\nMy partner, Heavy's gang related, scorin' fo' and five raw bricks\nAnd last week he brought six from Pretty Boy (Huh)\nPretty Boy got good hair with light skin (Mm-hmm)\nPuerto Ricans love this boy 'cause he fit right in (Okay)\nThey blessed the cat with thirty bricks or more\nHe keeps that money right for now but Pretty Boy got dirty fix galore\nAnd he's just waitin' for the right time (What?)\nTo plight his crime (Huh?), and he gon' get them Ricans for a righteous dime (Okay, nah)\nHeavy got his gangsta chick\nShe cooks a meal like Ain't Ya Mama but's inclined to keep a player rich (Okay)\nWe gon' say her name is Tisha\nShe's down to bake a sweet potato pie then make a dope deal with ya (Nah)\nHer and Heavy makes the team and her and Heavy wears a ring\nBut, her and Heavy does their own thing (Mmm)\nIt's kinda hard for me to put to rhyme (Okay)\nSo I'm leave that where it's at and then jump back into this story line\nHev' and Pretty's kinda cool (Cool)\nSo when Heavy would score his work, Pretty Boy would usually push him two\nOr three, basically whatever Heavy needs\nBut if Heavy had Pretty's hookup then the streets would bleed (Okay)\nAnd Heavy knew that, that's where the betrayal grew at\nIf not, they both could've flourished and been a hell of a duet\nBut then the seasons had to change, the reasons all for change\nColdest summer ever, and that was strange\n[Chorus]\nThe coldest summer I've ever seen\nThe coldest summer there's ever been\nThe coldest winds that have ever blown\nThe coldest summer I've ever known\nThe coldest summer I've ever seen\nThe coldest summer there's ever been\nThe coldest winds that have ever blown\nThe coldest summer I've ever known\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow Pretty Boy done knocked the Benz (What kind?)\nHe already had him a 5, he knocked the 6 so he's flippin' twins (Uh)\nAnd Heavy's watchin' with the big eye (Mm-hmm)\nHe's sayin', \"This nigga don't deserve all he got and if I\nJust had his hookup then, things would look up\nI could scratch a meal and have my whole city shook up\" (Damn)\nBut, Pretty Boy's weak behind women\nSo while he's trickin', showin' his teeth, Heavy's sittin' with his mind swimmin'\nHe knows that Pretty wants to rob these Puerto Ricans\nSo he sticks the game to broad, Tisha, to get this nigga leakin'\nInformation 'bout the rip-off ('Bout the rip-off)\nHe figured that he can win a plug in exchange for a tip-off (Uh)\nAnd Pretty fell for the bait (Mmm)\nAnd Tisha eased up on this nigga with the grace of a snake and\nGot him drunk, talkin' shit with her (Damn)\nAt the club, swappin' with her, took her home and feed him good dinner\nAnd got in bed, dickin' the slit with her\nI guess it's safe to say she's got this cat hooked\nBut uh, somethin's wrong with this picture\nPretty's mind steady blinkin', sayin', \"Man, don't you recognize Tisha?\" (Mm-hmm)\nBut he can't make his mind remember\nAll he know is baby got a mouth piece cold as December\nAnd by the time she rode his piece again\nHe was puttin' in his mix and takin' Tish' would leave with meters men\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nThe coldest summer I've ever seen\nThe coldest summer there's ever been\nThe coldest winds that have ever blown\nThe coldest summer I've ever known\nThe coldest summer I've ever seen\nThe coldest summer there's ever been\nThe coldest winds that have ever blown\nThe coldest summer I've ever known\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow Pretty Boy's ready for this heist (Heist)\nHe's tryin' desperately to reach the Puerto Ricans he done paged 'em thrice (Thrice)\nAnd by the time he got them on the phone (Mmm)\nHe told 'em, \"Triple up my order, gimme one day, and I got it gone\"\nBut his plans was to skip town (Skip town)\nHim and Tish' goin' one way to Ohio to be Cleveland Browns\nBut Tish' told Heavy and (Heavy) Heavy told the Ricans (Ricans)\nAnd all the trust is out the window, everybody's leakin' (Uh)\nThe Puerto Ricans well they called up Pretty\nSaid, \"Meet up at that restaurant, we got your order ready\" (Got your order ready)\n\"Heavy, meet us at that spot, too\n'Cause if this nigga don't got no bags packed, well then we got you (Mm-hmm)\nWith ninety birds in the trunk of a Escalade\"\nThey feelin' hurt because this here is quite a test of faith (Damn)\n'Cause Pretty Boy's like a brother to 'em (For real)\nBut if this nigga's got his luggage in his trunk, well then they gots to do 'em (Mm-hmm)\nIt's 9 o'clock in the PM (Uh-huh, PM)\nThey in Spaghetti Warehouse parkin' lot, Pretty doesn't see them\nNext to Heavy and his 'Burban (And his 'Burban)\nWell at least he thinks it's Heavy in his Chevy but he's not for certain\nEvery man sprang loose from they vehicles (Mm-hmm)\nAnd things started in slow motion like when weed hit you (Mm-hmm)\nAnd neither man had they pistol drew\nBut then shots rang out from somewhere and everybody knew\nThat foul play had made its way to the playground (Uh-huh)\nThe Puerto Ricans was speakin' Spanish, yellin', \"Stay down!\"\nBut the sniper had 'em on the scope\nPretty Boy and each Puerto Rican took a bullet to they throat (Damn)\nAnd Heavy took a bullet to his brain (Mmm)\nThat's four dope dealers on the parkin' lot, layin' slain\nAnd out the bushes came Tisha Summers\nWith a thirty yard six she done won for ninety bricks (Oh, man)\n[Chorus]\nThe coldest summer I've ever seen\nThe coldest summer there's ever been\nThe coldest winds that have ever blown\nThe coldest summer I've ever known\nThe coldest summer I've ever seen\nThe coldest summer there's ever been\nThe coldest winds that have ever blown\nThe coldest summer I've ever knownEmbed"

(Yeah)\nBut that's me, and that's just the way that life goes\nI got to walk even though it ain't the shoes that I chose\n[Chorus: CP & Twisted Black]\nDo you wanna walk a mile in my shoes?\nDo you wanna live the life that I've lived?\nDo you wanna spend one day, just one night\nOn the pavement tryna beat me?\nDo you wanna go to places I've gone? (Yes, sir)\nMaybe even see the things that I've seen? (Okay)\nDo you wanna go against the grain (A'ight), for the love and the pain (Yeah)\n'Cause you can't stop chasin' green?\n\n[Verse 2: Twisted Black]\nCan you imagine a 12-gauge shot to your face? (Huh)\n10 years later, still got the gunpowder taste in your mouth (Okay)\nLeave a sting like it was some toothpaste (Yeah), on top of that\nI done slipped up and caught a new case for fighting laws\nPlus I'm broke (Uh), and my mama, she done married a man\nWho's a dope fiend, and he keep showin' love with his hands\nBut I'm locked up (Man), and I can't even chastise him\nAnd I forgot my gun shot, it left my left side limp\nI'm a hustla, but I done fell in love with the 'caine (Uh)\nI done went to snorting raw for camouflagin' my pain\nAnd I got kids (Huh), and I can't even look in their eyes\nI don't want them to figure out that I'm a beast in disguise\nI told the Lord in the pray, \"Laced my shoes too tight (Shoes too tight)\nI read the Bible front to back, but still I won't do right (Won't do right)\n'Cause I'm a fuck up, and all I really know is the streets\"\nAnd even though I'm out the South, I keep on holdin' this heat, it's my shoes\nYou might also like[Chorus: CP & Twisted Black]\nDo you wanna walk a mile in my shoes?\nDo you wanna live the life that I've lived?\nDo you wanna spend one day, just one night\nOn the pavement tryna beat me?\nDo you wanna go to places I've gone?\nMaybe even see the things that I've seen?\nDo you wanna go against the grain, for the love and the pain (Huh)\n'Cause you can't stop chasin' green?\n\n[Verse 3: Twisted Black]\nSo I pace my streets without a conscience (Uh-huh), full grown gorilla\nWalk the beat just like a sergeant, from Berry to Miller\nYou got same cake, and want to get it gone? (Okay) Holler at Black\n'Cause I'm a hustla down to the bone, this ain't a act (Ah-ah)\nNow check my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 (Huh), and they'll tell you Black move weight from\nHere to San Diego (Okay), disappear like a Naval (Yeah)\nBlaxican amigo (Okay), come back with Cuervo (Whoa)\nWith white, to the wheat (Yeah), to the China, to the maple (Uh)\nNiggas know I'm game tight (Okay), plus I've got hands too\n145 pounds, bet I outman you (What you got?)\nBet I've got more gangster (Uh-huh), more hustle, more class\nMore better scars with more traps and more cash (Oh yeah)\nBet you can't see me on your best day (Ah-ah-ah)\nBet you never see this nigga fold up \u2014 What, nigga? Hold up\nBet you I'm the truth (Yeah), and I bet I penetrate it through the youth (Can I?)\nAnd I bet you can't walk in my shoes\n[Chorus: CP]\nDo you wanna walk a mile in my shoes?\nDo you wanna live the life that I've lived?\nDo you wanna spend one day, just one night\nOn the pavement tryna beat me?\nDo you wanna go to places I've gone?\nMaybe even see the things that I've seen?\nDo you wanna go against the grain, for the love and the pain\n'Cause you can't stop chasin' green?Embed"
