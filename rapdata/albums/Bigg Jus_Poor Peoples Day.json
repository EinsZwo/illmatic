Rushmore\nBringing you face to face with the newest in evolution\nWelcome to the future\nYou've been categorized and archived with pins stuck in your abdomen like a pretty butterfly\nYou purple?\nStep to a nigga and find out exactly what happens when doves cryYou might also likeEmbed"

We need more retirements and dying rappers\nHe livin' right next door to the house of flying daggers\n'Cause niggas don't aim, they just fire random\nI take it all to my advantage just to gain leverage\nI see your brain hemorrhage\nBut you know we all battlin' the same devils kid\nA smear campaign like how blood paint ghettos\nAnd niggas is jaded, some of 'em still stay mellow\nThis ain't my fluency, your crew and me\nBout to form our own little mutiny\nShatter, throw rocks through your windows of opportunity\nY'all better run up on Latifah, talkin' bout unity\nFuck the fingers, Spekt got a sticky hand\nTurn a corner desolate hood into Disney Land\nB.C. run up like \"gimme that\"\nWe bout to drop more hits, it's the gutter Terry Lewis and Jimmy Jam\nPeep this international smash house\nDirty needle mark fiends is Pookie\nSmokin' rocks in a glass house\nDon't make me lash out\nStick the club up, everybody put they hands down\nNorth America leave niggas trapped in freedom\nAsk your people\nBefore they get lined up stiff as a wax museum\nNiggas is illin' to act indecent\nCan't tell me shit when mami wanna scratch the ceilin'\nAlexander set to conquer shit\nDifferent continents\nCarbon blade camouflage Bathing Ape sponsorship\nThey don't wantin' it\nAnd we the most dominant with the dirtiest flavor\nYou feelin' like you back up in the 36 chambers\nGive me so much dap 'til I had to learn he a hater\nBrush they hands off the shoulder like \"you disturbin' me player\"\nMust not have heard we was major, he just an idiot\nBrodie never level the playin' field when we blitz, it's hideous\nBut we got a bad rep for bein' insidious, and all my affiliates\nSmack y'all niggas to death, that's how we really get\nYou might also like(Really get\nG-Man and Lune TNS gone let them know\nKeep them inside the cages\nOrbital shit\nTakin' all of your shit)Embed"

    "lyrics": "When They Start... That 1997 Uptop Shit Lyrics[Verse 1]\nI feel as though I'm ancient\nTransversing through stages\nTrying to grasp the gravity of life shielding you from storms facing\nBut being a perceptive child it\u2019s time to knowledge truth\nFor you represent the base of the tree\nI symbolize the root\nIn a world of smokescreens we impact everything\nBut often left powerless to control\nSo as you embark on your journey away remember the voyage home to your birth village\nWhere we long abandoned our wisdom\nTo navigate the treacherous path from earth ending or quell the anger and resentments toward our women\nFrom the highest state of consciousness we fell into a diabolical game of life that's rigged from the beginning\nWhere few men who wanted change didn\u2019t have the power and those who had the power to change the situation didn\u2019t\nSeeing the unseen\nThe story of an unknown generational being\nYour pops is a production of environmental misery\nYet seeking the truth is every intelligent man's responsibility\nTo pass down the foundation of guidance 'cuz yours is a stolen legacy\nWhere we teach strength to those who lost their will\n[Scratched sample]\nWhen we start the revolution all they'll probably do is squeal\nStart the revolution\n\n[Chorus]\nA lot of these thugs is ostriches who quick to bury their head than deal\nJah willing I\u2019ll be there to consult you when you find yourself alone on the battlefield\n\n[Scratched sample]\nNiggas know the deal\nWhen we start the revolution all they'll probably do is squeal\n\n[Verse 2]\nHow do I begin this history lesson\nHow do I teach my seed the government considers him opposition\nTargeted with entrapment for slave labor in a prison\nIf they consider him a threat Lord knows they try to kill him\nBut he must know about Tuskegee syphilis injections and how scientists turn vaccine into bio-weapons\nI'm out here trying to make sense of the time\nWhen you much too young to know the definition of genocide or how they lied about thirty million people on the continent of Africa getting aids from a monkey bite\nWe dealing with statistics the size of the entire US black population\nEvery man woman and child killed\n\n[Scratched sample]\nWhen we start the revolution all they'll probably do is squeal\nStart the revolution\nYou might also likeThey sleepwalkers\nThey sleepwalking\nWe call 'em sleepwalkers\n\n[Verse 3]\nThe greatest killing machine ever of all time was a silent weapon\nWhen it was applied gradually people learned to tolerate and adjust to its presence\nA killing machine so perfect at first they couldn\u2019t intellectualize it therefore they were afraid to ask any questions\nBut understand this:\nJah makes no perfect weapons\nYou will no longer be able to control us through suppression\nThe poor are getting hungry and our ribs are showing\nWhat was seemingly impossible to move mountains is now possible to remove mountains with high explosives\nI\u2019ll turn your NWO into a rubble pile\nLord please forgive me for as much heat as I've been through for raising a warrior childEmbed"
