Here come the gorillas in the mist\nAnd they dressed like Ice Cube was in 96\nStone cold jheri curls and not one drip\nI sleep with the worms 'fore I swim with the fish\nAnd I ride with my niggas 'fore I roll witta bitch\nIf it don't make dollars, it don't make sense\nAnd I almost got shot cause I hit a fence\nYou might also like[Chorus: Ice Cube & The Game]\nMotherfuckers ain't gon' learn, 'til the chronic blunt don't burn\nAnd you can't see nothin' but the ghetto bird\nLight shinin through the fuckin' palm trees\nCalifornia ain't a state, it's a army\nMotherfuckers ain't gone learn, 'til the chronic blunt don't burn\nAnd you can't see nothin' but the ghetto bird\nLight shinin through the fuckin' palm trees\nCalifornia ain't a state, it's a army\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nCall the U.S. government and tell em it's a motherfuckin code red\nNiggas tried to straight up jack me, now they both dead\nThird little nigga got away on his moped\nCaught him 'round the corner, put the beam on his forehead\nJumped in the Impala then smashed through the light\nWithout a one time in sight\nSo I bust a right on Century, headed to the L.A.X\nWhere there ain't nothin but fly bitches and jets\nIn and out of lanes and I almost wrecked\nOff brand nigga in the 600 throwin up his set\nHe must don't know I got the 40 on deck\nAnd the TEC tryna be Shabba Ranks, time to flex\nIt's the third this shit happened to me all day\nGuess it's time to add another dead body to the throw away\nSo I turned down my Spice 1 tape\nAnd hit the switch, emptied the whole clip in his fuckin face\n[Chorus: Ice Cube & The Game]\nMotherfuckers ain't gon' learn, 'til the chronic blunt don't burn\nAnd you can't see nothin' but the ghetto bird\nLight shinin through the fuckin' palm trees\nCalifornia ain't a state, it's a army\nMotherfuckers ain't gone learn, 'til the chronic blunt don't burn\nAnd you can't see nothin' but the ghetto bird\nLight shinin through the fuckin' palm trees\nCalifornia ain't a state, it's a army\n\n[Outro: Ice Cube]\nCalifornia ain't a state, it's a army4Embed"

My life\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nTake me away from the hood, like a state penitentiary\nTake me away from the hood, in a casket or a Bentley\nTake me away, like I overdosed on cocaine\nOr take me away like a bullet from Kurt Cobain, suicide\nI'm from a windy city like Do or Die\nFrom a block close to where Biggie was crucified\nThat was Brooklyn's Jesus, shot for no fuckin' reason\nAnd you wonder why Kanye wears Jesus pieces?\n\u2018Cause that's Jesus, people \u2013 and Game, he's the equal\nHated on so much, Passion of Christ need a sequel\nYeah, like Roc-a-Fella needed Siegel\nLike I needed my father, but he needed a needle\nI need some meditation so I can lead my people\nThey askin', \"Why, why did John Lennon leave The Beatles?\"\nAnd why every hood nigga feed off evil?\nAnswer my question 'fore this bullet leave this Desert Eagle\n\n[Hook: Lil Wayne]\nAnd I'm grindin' till I'm tired\n\u2018Cause they said: \"You ain't grindin' till you tired.\"\nSo I'm grindin' with my eyes wide\nLookin' to find a way through the day, a light for the night\nDear Lord, you done took so many of my people\nI'm just wonderin' why you haven't taken my life\nLike what the hell am I doin' right?

In the summertime)\nBringing some records out in Compton, expect only sunny skies (California sunshine in the summertime)\nAnd out in the Inland Empire it's going to be really, really hot (California sunshine)\nAnd even hotter weather is expected for the rest of the week (In the summertime)\nWith triple digit temperatures on the way (California sunshine)\nStay cool, California, it's going to be a really, really hot summer (In the summertime)\n[Verse 1: The Game]\nLast year, Jazze Pha got stuck up inside the Grand Lux\nThe most recent was 50 in Angola, that's what's up\nAny rapper can get touched, any bitch can get fucked\nUnder the California sun, Impalas and big trucks\nThey say Suge got knocked out, but don't play that nigga cheap\n'Cause your body might wash up by the courts of Venice Beach\nAin't shit sweet but my Swisher, ain't shit buzzing but my liquor\nCali' chickens go to the A to strip and come back a little thicker\nWith more ass than Deelishis, that's my flavor of love\nWe make it rain like Rain Man when he played with The Glove\nI'm the King to you pawn niggas, Punisher, Spawn niggas\nPlaying in green, Paul Pierce to you LeBron niggas\nWe done barbequed, front and back lawned niggas\nSummer Jam, throw your ass off stage, Akon niggas\nWe drink Kool-Aid with the ice on your arm, nigga\nTake that Champion hoodie off in the California sunshine\n\n[Chorus: Bilal]\nCalifornia sunshine in the summer time\nCalifornia sunshine in the summer time\nCalifornia sunshine in the summer time\nCalifornia sunshine in the summer time\n\n[Verse 2: The Game]\nI'm in my drop top Phantom down Wilshire Boulevard\nWe can't find Biggie's killers, so we gave Puffy a star\nAnd I'm by far Hollywood Boulevard\nBut I'm from a boulevard that taught y'all how to shoot out of moving cars\nRemember New Jersey Drive was like an east coast Menace\nAnd Belly was like the sequel without O-Dog in it\nGive me a New York minute\nTo show you Cali' got more dead bodies than the Yankees got New York pennants\n'Cause we Dodgers in Impalas with the windows tinted\nI duck shots where Venus and Serena used to play tennis\nAnd they never came back like throwing a boomerang flat\nSee, me, I'm posted like a Cincinnati pitcher in the same hat\nIt's like a scene from a movie when the screen fade black\nNiggas roll up on you, now you stuck in that Harold and Caine trap\nIf you slipping in Hollywood and you get your chain snatched\nI know some niggas that owe some niggas, I'll get your chain back\nYou might also like[Chorus: Bilal]\nCalifornia sunshine in the summer time\nCalifornia sunshine in the summer time\nCalifornia sunshine in the summer time\nCalifornia sunshine in the summer time\n\n[Verse 3: The Game]\nNiggas already know who had the marijuana first\nWe birthed Haze and Sour Diesel, I was there when the water burst\nHell nah, we don't surf, we halfway go to church\nTell you the truth, shit, right now I'm in a fucking hearse\nAnd it ain't my night to get buried in the dirt\nBut it is your day to get buried by a verse\nIt'll be another ten years 'fore you see an MC Ren here\nWhere he been, I've been there, that Lambo, I'm in there\nHotter than the beginning of my career with 50, Dre and Em there\nTop off the Murcielago like Victoria's Secret swimwear\nSo, listen, I'm so sincere, 'bout to work out like gym wear\nMurder MTV's top ten and tat my face with ten tears\nThat's ten funerals, ten caskets\nTen three-piece Ralph Lauren suits, ten motorbikes stopping traffic\nAnd ten reasons why I got California hotter than acid\nDon't you ever, ever leave me out the top ten, you fucking bastards, Bilal\n\n[Chorus: Bilal]\nCalifornia sunshine in the summer time\nCalifornia sunshine in the summer time\nCalifornia sunshine in the summer time\nCalifornia sunshine in the summer time4Embed"

Dodger, now I'm a (angel)\nFrom the city of lost souls, Impalas and polished gold\nBetween the car and the rims, we got a lot of chrome\nYour hood not alone, they knockin', we not at home\nAnd when they bust in, we not Caesar, but gotta roam\n'Cause they try to wire phones, I'm talking Verizon phones\nThe ones they put wires on, they got us on tap\nBut I put wires on, my Bentley in fact\nI spit it through the wires on a Kanye track\n[Chorus]\nI wanna turn up the sound and spread my wings\nBecause I'm riding with my (Angel)\nGoing through the city of the Chi\nMakes me feel like I'm in the city of (Angels)\nOhh, I wanna fly, fly away with my (Angel)\nShe takes me high, she will always be my (Angel)\n\n[Outro: Common]\nYeah, it's The Game and Common\nSpread your wings, follow your dreams\nThings will be so serene\nL.A. and the Chi is a team\nYeah, angel supreme, yeah, keep on\nYeah, it's for the world boy\nWe do it forever, yeah5Embed"

Then bring Naughty in\nThey say \"It Never Rain in Southern California\", Tony!

Probably not\n[Chorus: Sample]\nWay up high, saw it all\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nA whole new world outside this bubble\nWay up high, I will fly\nI will hover the world\nSaw it all\nI will hover the world\nSaw it all11Embed"
