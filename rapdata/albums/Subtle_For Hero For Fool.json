Not\nGum up bubble flavored up sitting on a more popular mechanics of a fifty foot flesh. Not\nWatch a thieving wallet going over the counter of botox. With your arms a great cops. Not\nNot god. Not done. So booking the atomic clock. Not sea loud to clear. Over a dozen boxed cars. Keys to the city\nYou're rap rock. Not blood. Not gold bonded. Not\nYou serious precarious, but with no snots\n\nAnd a sunset interjects\nDonating the kind of red you'd only see in stores\nAffording yourself a bit more clarity, some singular mood polarity\n\nAnd if you could, you'd have a close friend\nDrive you off into the sinking pinksEmbed"

Your hands and heart full of edge, you lift the mat gently\nAnd there beneath it's omen embroidered, sits an intact wishingbone...\nYou carefully lift your instrument of certain luck to the door\nAnd it slowly unclenches the scar seem set where it's keyhole would be....\nAnd so you snap bliss bone, cut wish and begin to lock pick...\n\nUntil you hear trough the thick of the door the deadbolt caughing loose...\n\nSuddenly the fear black above your skull, beneath your skin goes wild\nAs the door of your choice opens itself slowly...\nSealing off your face with perfect stripes of rising bone and angst\nOf alabaster and pit\nAllowing the bright right light of luck\nTo completely believe\nAnd eclipse you...Embed"
