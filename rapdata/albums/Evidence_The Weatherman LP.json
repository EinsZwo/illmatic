I've learned my lessons (Ev have patience)\nIt's simple, they neglect it\nThey win at chess, still lose at checkers\nThat ain't weakness, it's a death wish\nChoke 'em out; another off the checklist\nI came too far not to be respected\nAnd drove too far to hear they closed the guestlist\n(You gotta be kiddin me) A new rain out the smokin bar\nUmbrellas up, these cats are dogs\nAnd just because it barely ever hails in L.A\nThey say I can't reign the game and hail from L.A.?\nThey crazy!\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[PMD]\nWhen five-oh roll, they say what's the M.O\nAnother rapper was hit, by Mr. Slow Flow\n\n\"By Mr. Slow Flow\" {*scratched*}\n[Ev] That's what they call me this year1Embed"

Burn to death or freeze?\nHot's when you sellin' units, strictly word of mouth\nWe from the bottom of Cali, that's why the birds fly South\nFor the winter, copped a new crib, studio built in\nIt's hot, hot is not Paris Hilton\nTryin' to breathe, a cold world, inhale each breath\nStill the sun can't chill but everyday the West sets\n\n[Verse 4: The Alchemist]\nNow who's the hot shot, up in the hot spot\nWith a big knot from sellin' hot rocks, duckin' cops on hot blocks\nIt's hot so you roll in that drop-top\nThe feds hot on your case, they run up in your place no knock-knock\nWord on the street's somebody must have turned up the heat\nNow you headed for that white cell and that cold white sheet\nBetter stay cool as a fan when that man say freeze\nOr get your dome cracked, knocked out cold and need a Colpac\nIt's cold hard facts, I'm on the case like Kojak\nCold as a bitch that got a pretty face with no back\nIt's cold out, breath like a smoke cloud when I blow that\nWhen I finish rap I'm quittin' cold turkey so quote that\n[Hook]\nYou either hot, hot, hot\nOr you're not, not, not\n(What's our motherfuckin' names?\nBetter get it right, people better get it right)\n\"Evidence and Alchemist\", \"keep it hot\"\nYou either hot, hot, hot\n\"Like the sun burn, burnin' down your block\"\nOr you're not, not, not\n\"It's so cold\", \"I'll leave em froze like ice\"\n\"Hotter than lava\", \"colder than ever\"\n\"Evidence and Alchemist\", \"turnin' up the temperature\"Embed"

Lyrics[Hook]\n\nBorn in LA, it\u2019s hard to get star-struck\nBorn in LA so I always keep my guard up\nBorn in LA, must deal where I stay\nEveryday, everyday, everyday\n\n[Chace Infinite]\n\nI\u2019m from a city that breeds death, multiple shots firing\nHome of the violent niggas wilding, half-city half-island\nI was born in the wood, raised in the San Fernando valley\nWhere there\u2019s eses and mostly Bloods\nBig family so I had covers from different hoods\nThat taught me the landscape of the city and I was good\nDriven by the desire to document the lives under fire\nThen present it to you through the wire\nHad to struggle with gang codes and navigate a path\nThrough the maze of Los Angeles becoming a man\nHopes become smoking the lung up here in the can\nThese streets respect killers and I\u2019m just a man\nBut yet it\u2019s still ? remember that Chace told ya\nThe nation is infected by LA gang culture\nI\u2019m an all-game reporter live from the center\nWhere respected as an artist and a thorough street, nigga\nMy birthplace, my home, and I\u2019ll be buried on Prairie across the street from where I was born in LA\n[Hook]\n\n[Evidence]\n\nI\u2019m from a place where stars are born\nWeather is never cold, hearts are never warm\nThe gang capital, night time injection, cut life is lethal\nAnd daytime is a sunny place for shady people\nIt\u2019s your boy, my father stole his son out the hospital\nNo loot wasn\u2019t stopping his joy, had it popping\nRaised in Santa Monica till their divorce\nSix years old, I couldn\u2019t see what was coming\nOf course the plan, mom bounced on old man\nThen we moved to the Venice sand\nA young youth seen gangs firsthand\nFaked address for school, two educations\nRich friends then back to my land\nYou was hard where I\u2019m from, it\u2019s a well-known fact\nWhether a white cat, brown, or black\nWhen you heard shots it was never from starter pistols\nEvery night\u2019s Fourth of July, launch your missiles\nLA is different since my best friend is gone\nSome moved locations, some just moved on (Rest in peace)\nThe neighbourhood changed, new faces came along\nHad me asking myself if this a place I belong\nMy hustle is strong, I\u2019m up before them\nRap caffeine marathon long, determined\nVenice, California, 90291, let\u2019s go\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[Sick Jacken]\n\nI got a sixth sense for danger man, a second-hand nature for war\nThe biggest rivals in my city is the law\nI\u2019m from that Pico Union district homie, fuckk what you thought\nWe got trees, windows, and raw, whatever you on\nI\u2019m just a pawn in that federal plan to get us all on\nA nice little high, shoot each other for crumbs\nOne by one, dying from wars that\u2019s won by none\nSome might come and make a bastard out of my son\nSo I\u2019m strapped with a gun making sure the axis that come\nFrom my body are only medicine pass through my lungs\nI got that downtown psyche, Cortez with a Nike logo\nLocos like me treated pipes like wifeys\nBuying up and down the blocks nightly\nDon\u2019t take my block lightly\nWe\u2019re screwed up like everybody in the world might be\nBorn into Union the 17th out the womb\nIn the 70\u2019s repping Lost Angels through the musical melodies\n\n[Hook]2Embed"

Flash flood warning is still in effect, and all beaches are closed. Homes along the coast have been evacuated, from Palos Verdes to Oxnard, and [?] is closed as well. However, we've got some good news. Our radars indicate that we will see the sun poking through the clouds as early as tomorrow morning. I do hope, if you're visiting the Greater Los Angeles area this week, you still managed to have a good time. Stay tuned as always for dependable weather updates from your friend Cap.
