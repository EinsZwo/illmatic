This sure hit alone'll bury ya\nAnd even if I got deported, I own America\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe's so crazy -- I smash rippin up the place\nGive the mack a taste -- I wipe my ass with a rapper face\nCars come to a dead stop\nRain find ways not to drop on my headtop\nTycoon rush at the richest\nEven my complexion is a must-have to bitches\nEven without, car money to budget\nI would have the most elegant apartment in the projects\nKnahmean?  Bitches are in awe * at the lingo\t\t* (pronounced OAR)\nKnow that Rick'll put an end to all rapper income\nAn old-timer, lock up all vagina fills\nFrance nor Italy can fuck with my designer skills\nSaltin inferior, faultin to where we are\nTryin to find fault in superior\nLet me slow it down, that's enough of that\nThis I have to say, to you nothing other rapper cats\n\n[Chorus]\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nYou lack the taste hook I'm stickin em with\nWhile degenrate like yourself make our race look ignorant (mm)\nAnd your girlfriend wanna kiss and deploy\nBout in the groin gets none of this tenderloin\nFeet planted on deep black firmament\nBow -- in the presence of who lead rap permanent\nLike a lion rap rips a chunk of kids\nYou stunk, cause mortals ain't shit to conquer\nSomebody said new pharoahes have appeared\nHow when everything I wore ten years ago you wear now?\nI coulda murder heard a word out quick Rick stomp it kid\nHung to it, you complete bum to Rick\nSource Awards, yeah Rick every seminar\nEven make Sadaam Hussein tell me where the weapon are (mm-hmm)\nLet me slow it down, that's enough of that\nThis I have to say, to you nothing other rapper cats\n\n[Chorus]Embed"

    "lyrics": "2 Way Street Lyrics[Verse 1]\nWell, I shot some deer, then I copped some beer\nAnd did a show up in West Bubblefuck somewhere\nDue to rap's wider ratio, satellites to Nato\nHillbilly drawers flew on the stage like tomatoes\nApparently more mack than I thought\nUnfortunately, wife piece back in New York\nAnd I'm starvin'\nBeing human and open with\nA mad fine hillbilly woman was scopin' Rick\nThought entered how to lean and bent it\nThough I'm not gonna lie, I was extremely tempted\n(To what, Rick?) To discharge in a sister\nNext thing, in the dressin' room, \"Pardon me, mister\"\nYes, I said cautiously, \"Crazy, but possibly you could sign\nYour name on the back of these Dazy Duke shorts for me\"\nTry to resist, now girlfriend startin' it\nThe pen won't write, \"You can press down hard on it\"\nNow, my hand browsin' her South end\nSpun around about to shove my tongue in her mouth when\n(Rring!) Loosen the grip my hell had\nMy girl, she was talkin' so nice I felt bad\nBeing untrue, no tellin' what it might do to her\n\"I love you\", forced to say, \"I love you back, too\" to her\nAny thought of gettin' pussy was doomed too\n\"You got a wife?\", anniversary comin' up soon, too\nGot off the phone, cock just got mute\n\"Don't get me wrong, it's not like you're not cute\" (Uh-huh)\nI'm wrong for mistreatin' her, the wantin' to skeetin' her\n\"I understand, goodbye, it was real nice meetin' ya\"\nWhat an angel overcomin' his wrongness\nThe moral I am tryin' to get across in this song is\n[Hook]\nIf goodness is what you're fillin' your soul with\nAnd wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with\nWho keeps no secret, like who they creep with\nRealize early, it's a 2 way street, kid (Say what?)\nIf goodness is what you're fillin' your soul with\nAnd wanna find a woman you can chill and grow old with\nWho keeps no secret, like who they creep with\nRealize early, it's a 2 way street, kid\n\n[Verse 2]\nCasually seatin' with some thick chords eatin'\nWith my album playin' at a big board meetin'\n\"I love this!\"\nBeing the coolest and the ruffest\nA big willie woman pulls the Ruler in her office\nAnd fixed a wedge in her garment, unsteady my heart went\n'Cause her office looked like a three bedroom apartment\nPoundin' was inevitable\nShe said to me, \"Rick, I think your album is incredible\"\nThe way the hon' upon I, comin' on a sun I\n\"You're so darn sexy with that patch over your one eye\"\n\"Well, I'm glad you think it's boomin' and I catch ya\nMeans a lot to me, comin' from a woman of your stature\"\nI mean, who could resist the Don head?\nStart caressin' Rick private, kiss me on the neck\nAnd I can't be held accountable if down her gown I pull\nGirlfriend pussy look plump and poundable\nShe sweats to set the emperor\nPut one of your legs up on the desk and let me enter ya\nFantastic, though I start to act drastic\nWhen I see my weddin' band 'pon the bitch left ass cheek\nDeep down, she felt that I tried to diss\nI'm like, \"I can't do this as much as I'd like to, miss\"\nAn angel overcomin' his wrong, kids\nThe point that I am tryin' to get across in this song is\nYou might also like[Hook]2Embed"

I mean, I do have neighbors\nSquirmin' away although the table was barrin' her\nFelt real good, my dick was sunk so far in her\nShe said it felt like a bulldozer boring her\nSquealing about she couldn't take it anymore in her\nMy cummed on her straight in the perm in her, (Here)\nAs I drained every last drop of sperm in her (Where?)\n[Chorus]\nSo, girls, when we kiss and we cuddle\nAin't no way to put it subtle when I want the butt hole\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnother girl I met, her experience vast\nBecause most girls with kids done been hit in they ass before\nPicked her up, sunset\nDon't be late for dinner, ma\nBringin' honey home from the date at the cinema\nThinking how to fuck the ass so plottin'\nBlown in the elevator, hit the stop button\nShe smiled, by knowing that her butt I wanna bore\nI said, \"Can I have a kiss now instead of in front of your front door?\"\nUhhmm, Oh yeah\nAlthough The Ruler tried not to push hard\nI'm all over the bitch like an octopus\nDeep down I know she also wanna fuck\nThough I kept my tongue in her mouth so not to put her on the spot\nTo have to talk no shit to prevent me from bonin'\nUnzap the bra, when the hooker start moanin'\nAnd expose my espresso, suck on her and lick on her\nUnbucklin' pullin' out mad long dick on her\nPanties in the way of that, but I want to check it out\nSlipped her wet drawers down her thigh and took her leg out\nHer butt was juicy, kinda fat\nSpun around, start to stick her in the pussy from the back\nShe came, mad juice dripped out\nStill in the pussy then acted like it slipped out\nCum on the floor, she said \"Pardon the puddle\"\nSpread open her cheeks, pushed hard in her butt hole\nUhhmm, wasn't a bad date at all, she went, \"Ahh, ahh\"\nStart pullin' at my balls while I'm still penetratin'\nFelt fantastic, she said\n\"Rick, I'm not really into this ass kick\"\nMeanwhile, Rick cummin' by the gallon\nPut your hands on the wall, please\nAnd try and keep your balance\nLickin' the grill in her, meanwhile fillin' her\n'Til sperm start pourin' out her butt hole while I'm still in her\nThen start rammin' the pine in her\nI almost picked her up with these final grinds in her\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nSo, girls, when we kiss and we cuddle\nAin't no way to put it subtle when I want the butt hole\n\n[Outro]\nMy ass, more, more, more7Embed"
