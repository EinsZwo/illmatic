If ya'll love me, nigga, wish me love\nAppetite for destruction, I'm back popping [?] again\nDrinkin' 'nac heavy until I'm happy again\n\nAlthough I get comfort from friends\nI won't be truly happy till I see him again\nSo until that day I'm goin' out in the blaze\nHope the world forgive me 'coz I lost my way\n\nI said there's no such thing as the straight path\nMy brother got hit the other day by straight blasts\nIn the brain, on the train, on his way to work\nA guy that spent most of his life dealin' with dirt\n\nBut as soon as he decides to get a 9 to 5\nWhy would God decide to take his life?\nThere's no such thing as the straight path\nDisappointedly, the craziest things happen\nI mean, never knew I'd lose so many people, you know\nSuch a short time, you know what I'm sayin'?\nI'm only twenty five, know what I mean?\n\nLord, it was not even like I was fifteen know what I'm sayin'?\nLost all hopes by fourteen, know what I mean?\n[?]\nLot of stress, man, right now\n\nSo much [?], yo, it's time, hold your head up [?]\nAnd to my man Lou who just passed, know what I mean?\nAll this nonsense goin' on in the street\nIt's just that life we lead know what I'm sayin'\n\nWe caught up in it man, but just when you do dirt\nJust know you can never clean it up man\nThere's no such thing as a straight path\n\nI said there's no such thing as a straight path\nUnless you come out the womb on a straight path\nAnd if you live, way I live, dog, how long can that last?\nWhen everyday of our life we live more like a task\n\nI said there's no such thing as a straight path\nI said there's no such thing as a straight path1Embed"
