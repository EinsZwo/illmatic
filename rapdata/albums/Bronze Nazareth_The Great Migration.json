Uh (I got my head on right, you know?)\n\n[Chorus: Bronze Nazareth, Byata]\nOne hook, one kiss, one feel, one love\nTwo hearts, two souls, two roads, two of us\nOne plan... one plan...\n[Bronze Nazareth]\nYo, let's toast, dubbed behind the walls of my mind\nLet's elope out them pose of written roads with these lines\nI know you sit by the phone, hope your finger, hold the ring\nEven when the throne don't shine, you always a queen\nYour walls bleed, my sound, rain cascade down\nShe ride, I hold it open, see, we \"Love Spell\" bound\nI'm from Gun Rule, where flowers don't grow, only the trees\nI mold the globe like holy bowls of pottery\nHonor me, five fifths, a man, dealt a different hand\nWith specific plans, to own my own strips of land\nYour eyes glow like the cosmics, she responded\nSmile like the winds of Egypt, notice the sweet lips\nLove your brown shade, can I write you a serenade\nWalk in purple rain, and talk amongst the flood plains\nMy campaign remains to over flow your chains\nIn the way beems of light, I plan to die\nDeep slide, and swim laps in your sinapse\nPin back your legs til your walls collapse, I slide through\n\n[Byata]\nThere ain't nothing I wouldn't do for you\nI know you would die for you, so I would die for you\nSee I would give this all up, if you would ask me too\nRelax my mind, knowing that you got me, boo\nYou my king, I'm your queen, you my sun, I'm your earth\nWords can't even express how much I love this worth\nDisperse flows to express my, heavenly bliss\nI feel blessed to possess a true love like this\nYou might also like[Bronze Nazareth]\nYo, she cool though, she know I wear a hoody to her funeral\nBlow a few at 'you-know-who', we travel like the news\nHow's paradise, share this life, Jamaican fahrenheit\nAs a man, I stand right to the course of the sun\nOnly happiness in life, is to love and be loved\nOne morning we can pause on the balcony warm weather\nAlone in the world, and watch our future together\nYour eyes be as wide as the heavens, I travel through you\nStand in timeless moments, go potent from the voodoo\nFires tremble, she crash just like the cymbal\nI might just ask you, to buy a Wu tattoo\nLet the clouds blanket you in my kingdom\nHold a delayed pen, when the jealous man's itching\nIt's tension, when it's pressure applied\nNobody fix your apron, ass shaking when you ride\n\n[Byata]\nYou ain't gotta think twice, you my prize for life\nI thank the highest for this gift, every morning I rise\nLook into your eyes, I can see eternity, you turning me\nOn, with your sweet words, so I dedicate this verse\nTo you, cuz this is what you deserve\nNothing less, with the best, I give you all of me\nYou sexy, whenever we be naked, L-O-V-E\nBaby, you got me going crazy\nAnd you know I love it when you call me your ladyEmbed"

Nigga, fuck ya life\"\nGood night, sometimes hell seems kinda nice\nShe came, tears streaming, like why'd they take his life?\nKissed his forehead in the coffin, good night\n\n[Bronze Nazareth]\nFloat through the day, like heroin in the veins\nOf a mad sinner, from whiskey to a bad liver\nIt's mad different, when he trying on my shoes\nMaybe they learn in turn, that I don't wanna breathe booze\nAnd they don't wanna sell birds, bricks and bodily germs\nJust try'nna reach our goals, so we reach for what burns\nAnd I probably know I'm wrong, but it's the same old song\nOn the radio playlist, how the sales made him famous\nAnd you probably wouldn't see us, just as niggas and felons\nMaybe you'll find promise in a box of eagle talons\nMaybe you'll see dreams in the eyes of the fiends\nAnd to trade green for green, is the best way, it seems\nNow we ain't say we innocent, angels, or preacher's sons\nBut you slap my hand away whenever I reach for funds\nAnger and pain, take a banger to George brain\nOn the train to nothingness, with Wildemere dreams\nIt ain't no time, when freedom is on the clock\nI either join your sports team or I bench press a Glock\nGood morning, I guess we never broke the slavery bonds\nCause I came out the precinct with the same chains on\nGood afternoon, I'm still laughing at the moon\nGood evening, we all poured our liquor out grieving\nPoured our liquor grieving..\nYou might also like[Hook 2: Bronze Nazareth]\nSaw him pull a pipe, like wait, I love life\nGood night, sometimes you die after you see the light\nHe shot to the side like last night's dice\nMissed the man on purpose, cause he regained his sight\nSaw him pull a pipe, like wait, I love life\nGood night, sometimes you die after you see the light\nHe shot to the side like Antonio McDyess\nMissed the man on purpose, cause he regained his sight\n\n[Outro: Bronze Nazareth]\nAnd that's how it goes, when it goes how it goes..Embed"

We can never move all this concrete\nTil blond streets, lead us to God's bronze feet\nWe'll be tusslin' on corners, musclin' owners\nCussin' out foreigners, mourners cry, watching funeral workers\nWord to Thelma from Good Times\nMy mind's a rhyme library the size of a high rise\n\n[Bronze Nazareth]\nYo, I'm a rare breed, you won't dare scheme\nI blow a hole through ya speakers, and watch ya snares bleed\nI spot and stare at fiends til they capillaries clean\nRhyme on the top of ferris wheels, until the beams lean\nI settle street dreams, show you their nightmares\nPeddle ice stares, so jagged that they dice pairs\nWhere angus beef lands after hands are slaughtered\nWard street marauders, sailing hardships thru life's harbors\nThrough hell or high water, low tide or heaven's gates\nEscape like seven freight trains, holding onto weight\nLike anaconda snake, a man who tarnish saints\nCertainly fakes, get stomped into surgery dates\nThe Ghetto's my toothpick, I spit candid hell scenes\nMy thought for food stay warm like handheld machines\nWith simple precision, I paint stills of the living\nBuild with the villains, dope fiends, and the victimsYou might also likeEmbed"

Lyrics[Intro: kung fu sample]\nYou're here to learn kung fu, remember?\nThis is not a rest home...\nNow go on, do some practice!\n\n[Bronze Nazareth]\nI'll probably never be as big as Slim Shady or Jay-Z\nEven though I write vivid like I'm Homer the Greek\nAnd study life like Socrates, without MTV\nYou think you're thugs, but for real, I sat with feds for robbery\nI'm try'nna walk the desert sands like RZA and Ringz\nGotta eat and beats don't pay the bills, unless you got a name\nLike The Neptunes, Jazze Pha or Kanye West\nAnd if your album ain't five mics, don't front like it is\nI got classic material without a mixtape host\nLove Pac and B.I.G., but I miss Pun the most\nI'm so underground, I play beats on the bones of Medgar Evers\nSitting next to Murs, Immortal Technique and The Beggaz\nLike Vernon Johns with no voice, you'll never hear my message\nNot on the block, selling cooked rocks to my sisters\nNot in the club all hard with credit cards in your ass\nDropped in 86, got mad when Goodie Mob didn't last\nJust wanted more \"Soul Food\" and an occasional \"party\"\nJust wanted you to hear what I say, love it or disregard it\nJust wanted Hot 97 to play my shit, like they promised\nThey never did, but probably payola was honest\nI'm like Van Gogh's paintings, you'll never hear my talents\nIt's the sound of neglect, that makes me green with malice\nSerch can't find my music, he ain't answer me in a while\nI was hoping The Unknown album got signed by Kevin Liles\nBut I never heard back from him, or Artist Direct\nSat in my room and watched Stagga Lee disrespect rap\nWhile Khia got her neck and back, licked by the millions\nI tried to tell you about history, mansions and killings\nLike how the Wu-Tang gave the knowledge, but you just wanted to dance\nShit, my own family and friends ain't buy Birth of a Prince\nMy debut, startin' to wonder what's the fucking purpose?\nYou faggots rhyme weak, but everybody's spitting verses\nWe used to follow Martin Luther, up in Capitol Hill\nNow you follow every rap artist whose throwback is ill\nAlbums weak now, internet didn't fuck up no sales\n12 producers, on 12 songs, the shit can't gel\nIt's just a compilation album, full of your wack songs\nAnd bitches dancin' all in your video with black thongs\nAll I wanted was for Steve Rifkind to listen, push play\nAnd for those who's not listening, to hear what I say\nFuck, man....You might also likeEmbed"

Moms heard me scream, like I've been scorned\nThe beef so supreme, Lord, vatos got hoes\nPlaying for my house doughs, another dose of some vicadine\nSlicing in, jutting in, like sudden cutting wind\nAnd we got severe strokes, sword tip, pin popes, send folks\nTo hell, when the doors close, it's hard here, my dear\nKiss your chin, missed again, this is Michigan\nAKA Babylon Ceasar Sin, it's me again\nGrabbing at your back door like a raptor, you need me, you actors\nRevelations, came in, deteurate men and women\nMC's.... go home and smoke them leaves\nSlice and dice, pure rate, my forte is swordplay\nChop-off-ya-limbs day, sway off strings of ligaments\nThis nigga bends, Kevlaar lives, and rock, black Timbs\nOnly wins, between punching, dungeon walls, and basements\nRelentless, Killa Bee, sting like flying jellyfish\nA king walks around, with a pen and a severed wrist\n[Chorus: sample]\nOh... I want you to know\nMy life is yours to share\nJust assured, as the skies are blue\nI said..\n\n[Bronze Nazareth]\nYo, in the streets, jungles deep, run from man, haunted lands\nSkeletons, they haunting man, you argue fam, we flaunting hands\nIt might just, let the pipes bust, in a birth canal, I creep from wells\nWith secret spells, that teach and tell, my speech'll kill, as deep as hills\nAs deep as steel, we dwell on scarred blocks, where they scar cops\nThey don't even come, for evening suns, I'm grieving, and be needing guns\nCause stocks and bonds are far beyond, the poverty lines, we stand for years\nHooded life, crimson rain, singing in the veil of tears\nTrail of beers and vodka, I'm on a, different planet\nI crack skulls like granite, that was blast out of cannon\nFrom standing on porches, to handing off roach clips\nI'm so swift, I broke ribs, and came back like Joe Gibbs\nBlow kids out boxes, box cutters and Glock clips\nThe loudest, obnoxious, shots, just woke me\nFrom my worst, nightmare, we thirst for light years\nCause dark days and brain stays, over me, like no one seem\nCan't control the scenes, I'm just an actor in the scripts of life\nMy pen poison is quick to strike, cause skin moistness, my kryptonite\nI skipped a hype, and took the elevator, toward heaven's light\nYou might also like[Chorus]Embed"
