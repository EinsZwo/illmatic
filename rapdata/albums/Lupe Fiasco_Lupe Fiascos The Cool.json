You?\nDid you improve on a design? Did you do something new?\nWell, your name ain't on the guest list, who brung you?\nYou\u2014the more famous person\u2014you come through\nAnd the sexy lady next to you, you come too!\"\nAnd then it hit me, standing outside of heaven\nWaiting for God to come and get me: I'm too uncouth\nUnschooled to the rules and too gumshoe\nToo much of a newcomer and too uncool\nLike Shadow and Lavelle, I battle with it well\nThough I need a holiday like lady who sung blue\n\"Go back, whatever you did, you undo.\"\nHeavy as heaven, the devil on me two tons too\nHa, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha\n[Chorus: Matthew Santos]\nIf you are what you say you are\nA superstar\nThen have no fear, the camera's here\nAnd the microphones\nAnd they wanna know, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]\nAnd you better wear your shades\nThe spotlights here can burn holes through the stage\nDown through the basement, past the Indian graves\nWhere the dinosaurs laid and (Pew!)\nOut through China, nearly misses airliners\nMagnified times five, this was pointed at the rhymer\nRicochets off the moon and sets the forest ablaze (Woo!)\nNow, that's important to say\n'Cause even with all that, most of us don't want it to fade\nWe want it to braid\nMeaning we want it to grow, meaning we want it to stay\nLike the governor called, and he told him to wait\nUnstrap him from the chair, and put him back in his cage\nThe audience ain't fazed\nAnd they ain't gon' clap, and they ain't gon' praise (Uh)\nThey want everything back (Back) that they've paid\n'Cause they've been waiting since ten to see the lights get dim\nHa, ha, ha, ha-ha-ha\n[Chorus: Matthew Santos]\nIf you are what you say you are\nA superstar\nThen have no fear, the crowd is here\nAnd the lights are on\nAnd they want a show, oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah\n[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]\nSo, chauffeur, chauffeur, come and take me away\n'Cause I've been standing in this line for, like, five whole days\nMe and security ain't getting along, and when I got to the front\nThey told me all of the tickets were gone\nSo just take me home where the mood is mellow\nAnd the roses are thrown, M&M's are yellow\nAnd the light bulbs around my mirror don't flicker\nEverybody gets a nice autograph picture\nOne for you and one for your sister\nWho had to work tonight but is an avid listener\nEvery song's her favorite song; and mics don't feedback\nAll the reviewers say, \"You need to go and see that!\"\nAnd everybody claps, 'cause everybody is pleased\nAnd then, they all take the stage and start performing for me\nLike, \"Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha\"\n\"Ha, ha, ha-ha-ha, ha\"\n[Chorus: Matthew Santos & Lupe Fiasco]\nIf you are what you say you are\nA superstar\nThen have no fear, the camera's here\nAnd the microphones\nAnd they wanna know, oh, oh, oh, oh\nIf you are what you say you are\nA superstar (Superstar)\nThen have no fear, the crowd is here\nAnd the lights are on\nAnd they want a show, oh, oh, oh, oh (Yeah)\n\n[Outro: Matthew Santos]\nIf you are\nWhat you say you are\nThen have no fear49Embed"

Well I'm like ten, eleven\nBeen fighting since I was like six or seven\nNow I don't know much about where I'm from\nBut I know I strike fear everywhere I come\nGovernment want me dead so I wear my gun\nI really want the rocket launcher but I'm still too young\nThis candy give me courage not to fear no one\nTo feel no pain and hear no tongue\nSo I hear no screams and I shed no tear\nIf I'm in your dreams then your end is near, yeah\n[Chorus: Nikki Jean]\nLittle weapon, little weapon, little weapon\nWe're calling you\nThere's a war, if the guns are just too tall for you\nWe'll find you something small to use\nLittle weapon, little weapon, little weapon\nWe need you now, blaow!\nYou might also like[Bridge: Lupe Fiasco]\nAstaghfirullah\nAstaghfirullah\nAstaghfirullah\nAstaghfirullah\nAstaghfirullah\n\n[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]\nNow here comes the march of the boy brigade\nA macabre parade of the toys he made\nIn shemaghs and shades, who look half his age\nAbout half the size of the flags they wave\nAnd camouflage suits made to fit youths\n'Cause the ones off the dead soldiers hang a lil' loose\nWhere AK47s that they shooting into heaven\nLike they tryna kill a Jetson, the struggles, little recruits\nCute, smileless, heartless, violent\nChildhood destroyed, devoid of all childish ways\nCan't write their own names\nOr read the words that's on they own graves\nThink you gangsta? Popped a few rounds?\nThese kids'll come through and murder a whole town\nThen sit back and smoke and watch it burn down\nThe grave gets deeper the further we go down, it's\u2014\n[Chorus: Nikki Jean]\nLittle weapon, little weapon, little weapon\nWe're calling you\nThere's a war, if the guns are just too tall for you\nWe'll find you something small to use\nLittle weapon, little weapon, little weapon\nWe need you now, blaow!\n[Verse 3: Bishop G]\nImagine if I had to console\nThe families of those slain I slayed on game consoles\nI aim, I hold right trigger to squeeze\nPress up and Y, one less nigga breathe\nB for the bombs, press pause for your moms\nMake the room silent, she don't approve of violent games\nShe leave, resume activity\nScarred and blue heart, of hard, sharp wizardry\nOn next part, I insert code\nTo sweeten up the little person's murder workload\nI tell him he work for CIA with A\nA operative, I operate this game all day\nI hold the controller connected to the soldier\nWith weapons on his shoulder\nHe's only seconds older than me\nWe playful but serious\nNow keep that on mind for online experience, ugh!\n\n[Chorus: Nikki Jean]\nLittle weapon, little weapon, little weapon\nWe're calling you\nThere's a war, if the guns are just too tall for you\nWe'll find you something small to use\nLittle weapon, little weapon, little weapon\nWe need you now\nLittle weapon, little weapon, little weapon\nWe're calling you\nThere's a war, if the guns are just too tall for you\nWe'll find you something small to use\nLittle weapon, little weapon, little weapon\nWe need you now, blaow!22Embed"

(Dumb it down!)\n(Dumb it down!)\n\n[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]\nI'm fearless, now hear this, I'm earless\nAnd I'm peerless, that means I'm eyeless\nWhich means I'm tearless, which means my iris\nResides where my ears is, which means I'm blinded\nBut I'ma find it, I can feel its nearness\nBut I'ma veer, so I don't come near\nLike a chicken or a deer, but I remember\nI'm not a listener or a seer so my windshield smear\nHere you steer, I really shouldn't be behind this\nClearly cause my blindness\nThe windshield is menstrual, the whole grill is roadkill\nSo trill and so sincere, yeah, I'm both them there\nTook both pills when the bloke in the trench coat\nAnd the locs in the chair had approached him here\nMade it clear as a ghost or a biter of the throats in the mirror\nThe writer of the quotes for the ghosts\nWho supplier of the notes to the living\nRiveting as Rosie, pockets full of posies\nGiven to the mother of the deceased\nAwake and at war 'til I'm resting in peace\n[Hook 1: Gemini]\nYou going over niggas heads, Lu (Dumb it down!)\nThey telling me that they don't feel you (Dumb it down!)\nWe ain't graduate from school, nigga (Dumb it down!)\nThem big words ain't cool, nigga (Dumb it down!)\nYeah I heard \"Mean and Vicious,\" nigga (Dumb it down!)\nMake a song for the bitches, nigga! (Dumb it down!)\nWe don't care about the weather nigga (Dumb it down!)\nYou'll sell more records if you (Dumb it down!)\n\n[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]\nAnd I'm mouthless, which means I'm soundless\nNow as far as the hearing, I've found it\nIt was as far as the distance from the earring to the ground is\nBut the doorknockers on the ear\nOf a stewardess in a Lear, she's fine and she's flying\nI feel I'm flying by 'em, cause my mind's on cloud nine\nAnd in a mine at the same time\nPimps see the wings on the Underground King\nWho's also Klingon, to infinity and beyond\nSomething really stinks, but I Sphinx like Leon\nOr lion in the desert\nI'm flying on Pegasus, you're flying on a pheasant\nWriter of the white powder, picker of the fire flowers\nSpit, \"hot fiya\" like Dylan on Chappelle's skit\nYeah, smell it on my unicorn\nDon't snort the white horse, but toot my own horn\nSleep?\nYou might also like[Hook 2: Graham Burris]\nYou've been shedding too much light, Lu (Dumb it down!)\nYou're makin 'em wanna do right, Lu (Dumb it down!)\nThey're gettin' self-esteem, Lu (Dumb it down!)\nThese girls are trying to be queens, Lu (Dumb it down!)\nThey're trying to graduate from school, Lu (Dumb it down!)\nThey're startin' to think that smart is cool, Lu (Dumb it down!)\nThey're trying to get up out the hood, Lu (Dumb it down!)\nI'll tell you what you should do (Dumb it down!)\n\n[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]\nAnd I'm brainless, which means I'm headless\nLike Ichabod Crane is\nOr foreplay-less sex is, which makes me saneless\nWith no neck left to hang the chain with\nWhich makes me necklace-less, like a necklace theft\nAnd I ain't used my headrest yet\nThey said they need proof like a vestless chest\nAbout the best-fed F-F jet in the nest\nWho exudes confidence and excess depth\nEven Scuba Steve would find it hard to breathe\nAround these leagues; my snorkel is a tuba\nLu the ruler around these seas\nWestside Poseidon, Westside beside 'em\nChest-high and rising, almost touching the knees\nOf stewardess and the pilot, lucky they make ya fly with\nPersonal floating devices, tricks falling out of my sleeves\nDavid Blaine, make it rain\nYou make a boat, I make a plane\nThen, I pull the plug and I make it drain\nUntil I feel like flowing and filling it up again\nWestside!\n[Hook 3: Gemini]\nYou putting me to sleep, nigga (Dumb it down!)\n'S'why you ain't popping in the streets, nigga! (Dumb it down!)\nYou ain't winning no awards nigga! (Dumb it down!)\nRobots and skateboards, nigga?! (Dumb it down!)\nGQ Man of the Year, G? (Dumb it down!)\nShit ain't rocking over here, B (Dumb it down!)\nWon't you talk about your cars nigga? (Dumb it down!)\nAnd what the fuck is Goyard nigga (Dumb it down!)\nMake it rain for the chicks (Dumb it down!)\nPo' CHAMPAGNE on a bitch! (Dumb it down!)\nWhat the fuck is WRONG WITH YOU?! (Dumb it down!)\n...How can I get on a song with you? (Dumb it down!)\n[Outro: Gemini]\nLook B, here's my main, my two-way\nUh, what should I, ah, here take this\nThat right there, fuck what my boys'll talk about me, nigga\nNigga, you hot to me! I like you! (Dumb it down!)\n\n[Outro 2: Lupe Fiasco]\nBishop G, they told me I should come down, cousin\nBut I flatly refuse: I ain't dumb down nothing!30Embed"

Is it girls? Is it money?\nThe world?\n\n[Verse 1 : Lupe Fiasco]\nOr is it something they can never believe?\nOr is it something you can never achieve?\nIs it beyond your means? Is it inside your dreams?\nCan it never come out cause it's scared to, unprepared to\nToo worried about the words of the people it's weird to\nYou don't want them to hear you\nYou just wish there was a door that would appear\nThat you can go disappear through\nWell I'm feeling your pain\nI was feeling the same, but I said I'd never feel that again\n[Chorus: Matthew Santos]\nWhen the fighters are all around\nAll the lovers are on the ground\nNo one will save you anymore\nSo what's happening? what you rapping about, little boy?\nIs it cars? Is it girls? Is it money?\nThe world?\n\n[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]\nMan, I really miss my pops\nHope that God watches over him and that he's on top\nThat there is no more disease and that he's alright\nThat he's one of the generals inside the army of the light\nAnd grandma, you know I had to bite something from you\nSo after every show it's \"peace, and much love to you\"\nAuntie Tweetie's on the way, please look out for that girl\nI know we'll meet again, so it's never me against the world\n\n[Chorus: Matthew Santos]\nWhen the fighters are all around\nAll the lovers are on the ground\nNo one will save you anymore\nSo what's happening? what you rapping about, little boy?\nIs it cars?

Not Mini-me's\nOnly Mini-me's, not a lot of hymns\nOnly one eye, whole lot of them\nSaw a cyclops, that's a eye clock\nLike a Rolex, with a eye patch\nSee what I got, matches on the wall\nPlus a crazy flow, suicide watch\nI'm just killin' time, plus I'm insane\nIn a straight jacket, but it's Romanelli\nI'm just gettin' back, for now it's kinda poor\nWant to have things, couldn't afford a Pelle\nSo don't mind me, cause I ain't got a mind\nI don't front hard, I ain't got a mind\nI'm just gettin' mine, but don't step here\nBecause it's something buried, that I didn't find\nAnd if I\u2019m on top like a mohawk\nI remember when, I was so not\nIt was no locks, man I couldn't ball\nI was so bald, Robocop\nI was Mr. Clean, now I'm Mr. T\nBut a different team, F&F rules\nCall me F.I., from the Westside\nAnd I'm underground, pepperin' you fool (yeah homey)\n[Hook 1]\nCreepin' on a come up, history, we gonna rewrite that\nLeft for a minute but I told you I'll be right back\nI know you're slummin' and you feel me want to be like that\nWell you can't see me, that's cause everything is black\n(Black, black, black, black, black, black, black)\n\n[Verse 2]\nAnd I'm feelin' good, like a villian would\nIf he was doin' bad, kill Superman\nTied to a log, pushed into a saw\nTake a little dog, right through the fan\nAnd it mean man, like a dictionary\nLike a definition, like you never listen\nNot the \"ition\" endin', but the deaf part\nBreak it in half, like an intermission\nYou'll see then, what I mean then\nOr what I meant there, doesn't impair\nNow you're learnin' it, keep rehearsin' it\n'Til it's permanent, like pimp hair\nGot an empire, I'm the emperor\nLike the cat were, I'll be faster\nYou're tryin' to add syrup, just to slow me down\nBut I blow 'em down, like I'm half-were\nThat's wolf-man, you got a full house\nI got a full moon, then I pull out\nThe ace up my sleeve, like my hand hurt\nLend me your chips, what they took now\nWhat they put now, gotta look down\nAnd check your shoulder, cause I'll be over\nLike a boater, you got boulders\nIn your loafers, put your foot down\nWhile I Ottoman, or a Laz-E-Boy\nOr a handstand, see I elevate\nLike Otis, my toes is\nAnd my flow sick, let it marinate\nTry to break it down, might take a while\nAll good though, I'll wait around\nWhile you chase it down, that white rabbit\nDown that long hole, like paper towels (yeah homey)\nYou might also like[Hook 2]\nCreepin' on her, come up mystery, we gonna rewrite that\nLeft for a minute but I tell you I'll be right back\nI know you're slummin' and you feel me want to be like that\nWell you can't see me, that's cause everything is black\n(Black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black)\n(Black, black, black, black, black, everything is black)\n(Black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black)\n(Black, black, black, black, you can't see me)\n\n[Verse 3]\nSo this light's out, like a lighthouse\nIn the daytime, make it lay down\nMake it go to bed, make it go to sleep\nLike Deebo, when he was chokin' Craig\nThat's a headlock, it's what I said I got\nThe whole game in, like shooter box\nThen the Sho Kosugi, if you don't know the movies\nI ninja vanish, Michael Dudikoff\nI get super low, I get super lost\nI be super cool, like a super boss\nSay they super bad, but they super soft\nLike super chicken, without the super sauce\nLet's step out, it's a rap now\nBlow your candles, and your lamps out\nWhen I pull up, you can pull the plug\nCause it's game over, it's a black out\n[Hook 2]\nCreepin' on her, come up mystery, we gonna rewrite that\nLeft for a minute but I tell you I'll be right back\nI know you're slummin' and you feel me want to be like that\nWell you can't see me, that's cause everything is black\n(Black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black)\n(Black, black, black, black, black, everything is black)\n(Black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black)\n(Black, black, black, black, you can't see me)1Embed"
