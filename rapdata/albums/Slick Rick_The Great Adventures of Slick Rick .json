(mhm-hmm)\nThere's just a few things that I've got to mention (mhm-hmm)\nThere's girlies out here that seem appealing\nBut they all come in your life and cold hurt your feelings\nI'm telling you, as Rick is my name\nI wouldn't trust no girl unless she feels the same\n[Hook]\nTreat 'em like a prostitute (do what?)\nDon't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop\n'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample\nListen up close, here comes my first example\n\n[Verse 1]\nNow ya been with your girlfriend for quite a while\nPlans for the future, she's having your child\nCelebrate with friends drinking cans and quarts\nTelling all your friends about your family thoughts\nOne friend was drunk so he starts to act wild\nHe tells the truth about the kid, \"It's not your child\"\nActing like a jerk and on his face was a smirk\nHe said, \"Your wife went berserk while you was hard at work\"\nAnd she led him on and tried to please him\nShe didn't waste time, she didn't try to tease him\n\n[Hook]\nTreat 'em like a prostitute (do what?)\nDon't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop\n'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample\nListen up close, here comes my second example\n\n[Verse 2]\nNow your wife, you buy the tramp jewels and clothes\nYou get sentimental and bring home a rose\nGive her everything 'cause you swear she's worth it\nAll your friends tell you \"The bitch don't deserve it\"\nLove is blind, so there goes your wealth\nUntil one day, you see things for yourself\nCame home from work early Mr. Loverman\nYou had a card and some candy in your right hand\nThere's the mailman, he was short yet stout\nHe went inside your house and didn't come back out, bust it\nJust a friendly stop, come on, is it?\nThe mailman comes and he pays your wife a visit?\nThe thought alone makes your temperature boil\nYou say to yourself \"She might still be loyal\"\nYou open up your door and stand in a trance\nYou see the mailman's bag and the mailman's pants\nCame home to party, at work had a hard day\nLook around your house and you say \"Where the hell are they?\"\nRun upstairs up to your bedroom\nYou look inside your room, you see something brewin'\nCover your mouth because you almost choke\nYou see the mailman's dick way up your wife's throat\nYou might also like[Hook]\nTreat 'em like a prostitute (mhm-hmm)\nDon't treat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop\n'Cause all they do is they hurt and trample\nListen up close, here comes my last example\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow your girl, she don't like to have sex a lot\nAnd today she's ready and she's hot, hot, hot\nAs you open up the door she says \"Get on the floor\"\nShe wants to try things she's never tried before\nShe takes off your drawers and works you over\nShe calls you Twinkles and you call her Rover\nNext thing you know the ho starts to ill\nShe says \"I love you, Harold\" and your name is Will\nThat's not the half 'til you start to ride her\nTake off your rubber and there's one more inside her\nIt's not yours - who can it be?\nI think it was a slick rapper, his name is M.C. Ricky\n\nTreat 'em like a prostitute\nDon't treat no girlie well, treat no girlie well\nTreat no girlie well until you're sure of the scoop4Embed"

Yeah\nHere we go\n[Verse]\nOnce upon a time not long ago\nWhen people wore pajamas and lived life slow\nWhen laws were stern and justice stood\nAnd people were behavin' like they ought to good\nThere lived a little boy who was misled\nBy another little boy and this is what he said\n\"Me and you, tonight we're gonna make some cash\nRobbin' old folks and makin' the dash\"\nThey did the job, money came with ease\nBut one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease\nHe robbed another and another and a sister and her brother\nTried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover\nThe cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic\nHe said, \"Keep still, boy, no need for static\"\nPunched him in his belly and he gave him a slap\nBut little did he know the little boy was strapped\nThe kid pulled out a gun, he said, \"Why'd you hit me?\"\nThe barrel was set straight for the cop's kidney\nThe cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure\n\"I'll do years if I pull this trigger\"\nSo he cold dashed and ran around the block\nCop radios in to another lady cop\nHe ran by a tree, there he saw this sister\nShot for the head, he shot back but he missed her\nLooked 'round good and from expectations\nSo he decided he'd head for the subway stations\nBut she was coming and he made a left\nHe was runnin' top speed 'til he was outta breath\nKnocked an old man down and swore he killed him (Sorry)\nThen he made his move to an abandoned building\nRan up the stairs up to the top floor\nOpened up the door there, guess who he saw? (Who?)\nDave, the dope fiend shootin' dope\nWho don't know the meaning of water nor soap\nHe said, \"I need bullets, hurry up, run\"\nThe dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun\nHe went outside but there was cops all over\nThen he dipped into a car, a stolen Nova\nRaced up the block doing eighty-three\nCrashed into a tree near university\nEscaped alive though the car was battered\nRat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered\nRan out of bullets and he still had static\nGrabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic\nPointed at her head, he said the gun was full of lead\nHe told the cops, \"Back off or honey here is dead\"\nDeep in his heart he knew he was wrong\nSo he let the lady go and he starts to run on (Uh-huh)\nSirens sounded, he seemed astounded\nAnd before long the little boy got surrounded\nHe dropped his gun, so went the glory\nAnd this is the way I have to end this story\nHe was only seventeen, in a madman's dream\nThe cops shot the kid, I still hear him scream\nThis ain't funny so don't you dare laugh (Uh-huh)\nJust another case about the wrong path (Uh-huh)\nStraight and narrow or your soul gets cast\nGood night\nYou might also like[Outro]\n(Knock him out the box, Rick\nKnock him out, Rick)\n- Oh boy, that Uncle Ricky is really weird\n- I know right what does he mean\n\u201cStraight and narrow or yo\u2019 soul gets cast\"?\n- I don\u2019t know, I think he be crackin' it up or something\n- Well, good night\n- Good night\n\nAnother (that's right!)

Take the shits off man!\nThe fuck is up?\"\n\n[Verse 2]\nI said, \"They're really not real, they're just a front for the girls\"\nThen a whole bunch of furious fists caved my world\nI was in pain, so ashamed, I wish I had not came\nHad to kindly pick up my face and then ride home on the train, then\nI went to an open store that's where I bought me a quart\nThen I went to the park, and I sat and I thought\nI seen Danny Boy though he's with his girl named Sarah\nIn one of his cars, I think this one's a Riviera\nShe calls out to me, but, I really couldn't hear her\nSo I went just a little bit closer so I'd hear a little clearer\nShe said, \"I need Veronica Place that's right near Tilden\"\nI said, \"I know where that's at cause that's right next to my building\"\nI gave em the information and they went on their way\nI went home, and there I slept til almost three the next day\nThen someone knocked on my door, I opened up, no quit!\nIt was Sarah with some magazines and a band-aid kit\nShe tried to use me and seduce me and at first I wasn't with it\nThen we did it and we did it and we did it and WE DID IT\nShe said it was great, she said she's glad we had done it\nThe elevator came and Danny Boy was on it\nYou might also like[Hook]\nThis was the moment I feared...\n\"Hey yo what the fuck's goin on here?\nWhat you doin to my girl homeboy?\"\nThis was the moment I feared...\n\"Oh I just KNOW y'all didn't just finish fuckin\nI just KNOW y'all ain't just finish fuckin\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell he was huffin and puffin and he swung at me -- word\nSo I pulled out my jammy and I silenced the nerd\nThen he was dead two in the head I took the cash and the Visa's\nShe said, \"Don't worry about a thing just make sure nobody sees us\"\nWe went back to her apartment, there was blow in the freezers\nShe said, \"We're rich we're rich we can have whatever will please us\"\nNow I don't hang with no one who ain't good for my health\nSo I put the sugarhead out and I went for self\nNow I was rich as I was rich I could have whatever would please me\nNow I could wear real gold in front of folks that would tease me\nYah me, I'll be a new neighborhood dad\nCats'll roll up on me screamin, \"Yo Rick my man!!\"\nI guess I was too fly word up I'm sorry to say\nYa see a cop rolled up on me and told me, \"Make my day\"\nI said, \"Relax brother,\" but he had proof that I had done it\nYep, he had poor Sarah's underwear with my fingerprints all on it\nThis was the rise and fall of my fast lane style\nAnd I was the main event on the TV for a while\nBut now I'm in jail doin life and I'm scared\nSome kids snuffed me cold and greased me where no one dared\n[Hook]\nThis was the moment I feared...\n\"Turn around nigga (HAHAHAHA)\nSpread your cheeks\"\nThis was the moment I feared...\n\"UHH, AOWWHWHWAA! STOP STOP! AHAOWWHAHAOOHO\"2Embed"

You got your own Timex\"\nTo poor old Dave that line was cold blooded\nIt seemed like her ego was way over flooded\nShe started to laugh and then she started to say\n\"I'm sorry some times I do get carried away\nI didn't mean to like ill treat you\nMy name is Running Rabbit and I'm glad to meet you\"\nHe said \"I'm Dave, with crazy clout\"\nShe said \"Oh you're the one the girls keep talking about\nYeah, you must be, because you look like a winner\nCome to my house, we'll discuss it over dinner\"\n(Singing)\nDavy, Davy Crockett, the Wild Frontier\n\n[Verse 2]\nWell, he met her father, Big Chief Beretti\nHe said \"What's for dinner?\" \"Soup and spaghetti\"\nThe dinner was rotten and he swore he's gonna puke it\nHe never would have took it if he'd known that he had cooked it\nLater on they was chilling in the bedroom\nSitting by the window looking on the Moon\nNothing was being said so he swore she was hot\nHe said \"Are you in the mood?\" She said \"No I'm not\"\nFrom what he believes and from what he guessed\nIf a girl says no, he really thinks she means yes\nSo, he started touching her and coming out strong\nWhispering sweet nothings and singing a song\nHe said: (singing) \"I'm in the mood for love\nSimply because you're near me\nFunny but when you're near me\nI'm in the mood, don't mean to be rude\nBut I'm in the mood for love\"\nAnd the she said \"Oh Dave, you've got my poor back hurting\nI want you, first close the curtain\"\nHe closed the curtain and also the doors\nThe next thing you knew it was off with those drawers\nYou might also like\"Take it easy Davy, you're hurting me. Stop\"\n\n[Verse 3]\nWell, he was playing with her titties, they were soft not lumpy\nAnd then he cracked the legs like Humpty-Dumpty\nHe's fucking, sucking, also finger popping\nHe had no intention of stopping\nCrazy fun, he did not want to leave\nHis head was between her tits and he could barely breathe\nHe had to toss, turn, turn, toss\nMeanwhile he was riding her with crazy force\nShe was burning hot, she said \"Stop, stop.\"\nHe said, \"Are you talking sex or what?\"\nI guess she didn't realize what she started\nNext thing you know she was acting retarded\nShe said to him strangely and kind of merry\n\"Stop now, or I'll be unable to marry\"\nHe didn't take her warning\nHe rode her till the morning\nHe rode that ass till the pussy started yawning\n*Yawning sounds*\nHe said \"What? Wait\" His dick went weak\nIt said \"Dave, pussies ain't supposed to speak\"\nHe took off his clothes he wanted to leave this place\nBut first he wanted to see the vagina face to face\nHe opened it up, with his bare two thumbs\nHe seen crabs with spears and Indian drums!\nThey's going:\nHeya hiya heya hey, hey\nHeya hiya heya hey\nHeya hey, heya hey\nHeya hiya heya hey\nHeya hiya heya hey2Embed"

And MC Ricky D!\nDoing their smash hit, \"Mona Lisa,\" you know, like the picture?\nAnyway, I'd like to take this time out to bow before his divine majesty\nOh, your majesty?\nHmm\nCan I kiss your hand?\nMm-hmm\n*Kisses*\nEnough!\nCome your highness, they await you\n[Verse: Slick Rick]\nWell, it was one of those days, not much to do\nI was chillin' downtown with my old school crew\nI went into a store to buy a slice of pizza\nAnd bumped into a girl, her name was Mona\u2014what?\nMona Lisa (What?), Mona Lisa, so men named you\nYou know what I'm sayin'? So I said\n\"Excuse me, dear, my gosh, you look nice!\nPut away your money, I'll buy that slice!\"\nShe said, \"Thanks - I'd rather a slice of you\nI'm just kidding, but that's awfully nice of you\"\nThe compliment showed she had a mind in her\nAnd when I smiled (PING!) I almost blinded her\nShe said, \"Great Scott! Are you a thief?\nSeems like you have a mouth full of gold teeth\"\nHa-ha, hah! Had to find that funny\nSo I said, \"No child, I work hard for the money\nAnd calling me a thief? Please! Don't even try it (Right!)\nSit down eat your slice of pizza, and be quiet\"\nShe almost got cut short -- you know, scissors\nShe tried to disrespect WHO?! The Grand Wizard\nMe! \"Well what's your name, son?\"\n\"MC Ricky D,\" but not to be so harsh I said to Mona Li-hee\n\"I'm.. sorry and I know that's low class (uhh, yeah)\nPlease sit, and tell me a little about your past\"\nShe said, \"Well I got courage, and I don't like porridge (uh-huh)\nI've never been to college, but I've got crazy knowledge (uh-huh)\nOver eighteen and my eyes are green (uh-huh)\nI wear more gold than that man on A-Team (uh-huh, uh-huh)\nTrim, slim, (yeah) and I'm also light skinned\nBest believe Mona's a virgin\"\nA virgin?! Honey needed a slap\nShe tried to tell me she's a virgin -- with her yay wide gap\nI said, \"It don't matter, see, I'm not picky (word)\nLet me spell my name out for you, it's Ricky:\nR - ravishing, I - impress\nC -- courageous or careless\nK -- for the Kangols which I've got\nThat I wear everyday and Y -- Why not?\nTo fight's not right that I recite and I'm..\nQuite polite like Walter Cronkite\"\nWell, just about then, Trevor my friend came in\nHe said, \"Hey Rick, don't you know playing with these snakes is a sin?!?\"\nHe grabbed me by my shirt and pulled me right out the store\nHe said, \"I don't want to see you playing with these lowlifes no more!\nNow come along, we have a party to attend\nWith some real mature women and some more of our friends\"\nHe hailed down a cab and he waited for a minute\nAnd as the cab came, he thrusted me in it!\nAnd as we were leaving and driving along\nI could hear a melody as Mona sang a song\nYou might also likeIf you see me walking down the street\nAnd I start to cry each time we meet\nWalk on by, walk on by, foolish pride\nThat's all that I have left, so, let me hide\nThe pain and the hurt that you gave me\nWhen you said goodbye\nYou walked on by8Embed"

We love the way you're moving it\"\nWho's hitting rough in eighty-eight I bet your momma knows\nBack slap you all down like y'all were dominoes\nStun em all, come on y'all, give me a taste of life\nAct trife, I'll let my dog go fuck ya wife\nSo be my friend and don't pretend you will not be forgiven\nYou're cleaning house up to the master, that's how we both are living\nSo who will stands, who falls, who crowds the halls?\nThis one the DJ calls... lick the balls!\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nGo Vance Wright! Go Rick! Look at the style we bring\nHow come you cannot write a rap that will erase the king\nThe girls you worship are some tramps and want to see me slam\nShit on mother fuckers and I tell them who the fuck I am\nMy name is Rick, but now you know who's ruling it\nPump the world and the DJ put the fuel in it\nCome ride the dick and if you wanna know what is the word\nWho write the baddest raps you and your boys have ever heard\nI eat you up and give your girl a bowl of Puppy Chow\nYou understand alright? Hello! I'm trying to tell you now\nWho stands, who falls, who crowds the halls?\nThis one the DJ calls... lick the balls!2Embed"
