Titanic dough (what?)\nWomen on my nuts like, \"Where the Titanic go?!\"\nI been scourin the Earth (yeah)\nMakin my fans catch the holy ghost at my shows like ya grandma at church\nAnd the fat lady's singin - it's over for you rappers\nCan't none of y'all bust, you're just sacs full of semen\nAnd I got the women screamin (AHHH!)\nThey could catch my balls on Any Given Sunday like my name's Willie Beamen\nOr LL Cool - so if your boyfriend\nThinks you loyal to his ass then he's a motherfuckin fool\nGot jewels on my pinky, jewels on my wrist (hey!)\nIconic status and his name is Ludacris\nBitch please! You messin with some real O.G.'s\nWith million dollar whips that I ship from overseas\nGot a pocket full of G's - and the inconvenient truth\nIs that the ozone is bad cause I been smokin' all the trees\nThe globe is warmin up when we fire up the blunt\nAnd put it in the air like Evel Knievel stunts\nWhat you want from me? (what?) I got pistols for the haters\nYour fam'll be in black like they was playin for the Raiders\nAnd your music isn't favored - and DJ's they NEVER bring it back\nLike when you go and borrow somethin from your neighbors\nLike a cup full of sugar, a rope full of salt\nThe name of my car insurance is \"YO' FUCKIN FAULT!\"\nAnd if you sittin' on chrome - I'll call up my boys\nAnd have you stripped of yo' metals like Marion Jones, nigga\n[Interlude: Floyd Mayweather Jr.] + (Ludacris)\nChamp you got it! Keep on movin\nThey ain't got nothin on you, watch for the sneak dissin\nThese boys'll smile in your face and stab you right in the back (I know)\nBring it, take some water\nThis is Money in the bank! (yeah)\nThey defeatin themselves, champ (yeah baby)\nYou know what you can do (I know)\nYou Luda! You lookin good, let's go! (aight)\nC'mon baby, hard work and dedication (yeah)\nYou know what it is man (aight let's go)\n{*ding ding ding*} Keep fightin!\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nYeah, back up on the scene (what?)\nBack to put a nail in these rappers' coffins\nI got the hammer in my jeans: call me Mr. Fix It\nBarrel stay hotter than\nA fresh batch of homemade buttermilk biscuits\nA-tisket, a-tasket, a custom-made casket\nLuda leaves intruders stretched out like gymnastics\nAnd acrobatics; I'm superstar status\nThe mouth of the South like Gangsta Grillz you bastards!\nThe international traveler\nAnd I may not be much to you, but I'm the SHIT out in Africa\nSo put ya fist up - even the Statue of Liberty\nLit a flame for the way that I lit my wrist up\nYou can't compete with me - I got 'em stuck\nLike I made a thousand rappers put shackles on they feet with me\nAnd then I broke free - I'll let 'em loose\nWhen Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston become drug-free\nI'm the baddest mother-shut-it like Shaft was\nLeavin' rappers with headaches like bad drugs\nThey shoulda warned ya - you got defeated\nBy the Heat, but ehh, we'll just say we Alonzo Mourn'd ya\nSo call the coroner (hey!)\nI'll show up to yo' funeral with some gators like I'm FRESH outta Florida\nCall me The Swamp Thang - y'all headed in the wrong direction\nLike you hit the subway and caught the wrong train\nSo don't fuck with it - I'm sendin' lyrical bullets\nRight at yo' dome, fuck niggas better duck with it (duck wit it!)\nOr else you stuck with it - you'll get stomped so bad\nYou'll leave the scene thinkin eight Young Buck's did it\nBut not in Ca$hville - you lost yo' feelin\nLike comin' down off X, chasin' effects of yo last pill (ha ha)\nYou fuckin' Daffodil, you's a Daffy Duck (what?)\nAnd I'm the undefeated champ, y'all niggas suck!\nYou might also like[Interlude: Floyd Mayweather Jr.]\nHa ha ha ha!\nI told these muh'fuckers can't fuck with you and me man\nI'm the best of the best, the head honcho\nThe el hombre intachable, man\nYou know what the business is, they can't fuck with me man\nYou know what my lifestyle is\nMan you know what I do, you can't fuck with me man\nWhat, a decade? What?\nI'll go ten more, they can't fuck with me man\nLifestyle, you know what it is\nGettin money man, let's go\n\n[Outro: Ludacris]\nYeah baby, yeahhhh!\nI'm the champ!

    "lyrics": "One More Drink Lyrics[Verse 1: Ludacris]\nIt was Friday night and I was feeling aight (Yup!)\nDowntown Atlanta, big city, bright lights\nMixing Henny with the Sprite while I'm drinking and driving\nNo police lights (Lights), no police sirens\nI'm headed to the club, looking for a freak (Freak)\nTo spread a little love, and spread a couple cheeks (Cheeks)\nPull up to the spot 26's like BAM!\nEyes on me like, \"Bitch, do you see him?\"\nStrolled through the front door, headed to the VIP (VIP)\nBought a couple bottles and I took a couple sips (Sips)\nScoping out the room, and what do I see?\nA nice round butt, and a pair of double-Ds\nSo I crept up, like, \"Shawty, what's hatnin'?\"\nYou killing that dress and I love it with a passion\"\nThen she turned around and her face was aight\nShe had a gap tooth and a mean overbite\nBut I was like, \"Hmm...\"\n[Hook: T-Pain]\nYeah, yeah\nIf I take one more drink (Drink)\nI'm gon' end up fucking you\nIs that what you wanna do, shawty?\nIf I take one more drink\nI'm gon' end up fucking you\nYou too, ooh, ooh, ooooh\n\n[Verse 2: Ludacris]\nWoke up the next morning and all I can remember (What?)\nWas taking shots and tippin the bartender\nSurrendered to the woman, end up bringing me home\n'Cause she started looking better every shot of Patr\u00f3n, yup!\nI jumped up with a devilish grin\n'Cause tonight, damn right I might do it again\nSo I called up the homies (What up?) Let's ride\nWe can hit the sports bar over on the south side (Aight)\nGet a couple of Coronas, couple of limes (Yup)\nWent up to the bar and saw a couple of dimes (Woo!)\nSo I, slowly walked up and said, \"Hi!\nMy name's Ludacris and I'm a hell of a guy\nOne said \"I know who you are, I'm your number-one fan\" (Woo!)\n\"And right now, it's too bad I got a man\"\nAnd I said, \"I understand\" (I understand)\n\"But where the hell is he at?\n'Cause in a minute, if he don't show up, then man...\nYou might also like[Hook: T-Pain & Ludacris]\nYeah, yeah\nIf I take one more drink (Drink)\nI'm gon' end up fucking you\nIs that what you wanna do, shawty?\nIf I take one more drink\nI'm gon' end up fucking you (Uh-huh)\nYou too, ooh, ooh, ooooh\nAyy, Pain, holla at 'em right quick, man\n\n[Bridge: T-Pain, Ludacris, & Both]\nYeah, you gon' get in trouble with yo' man, girl\nDon't get in trouble, girl!\nTalking 'bout how you're my biggest fan, girl\nI know it! I know it!\nNow I don't wanna do (Please!)\nWhat you gon' make me do\nDon't make me do it! Don't make me do it!\nBut I-I...\nIf I have one more drink\u2014\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\n\u2014I'ma get ya home, then I'll split ya\nGrab the cameraphone and take a bunch of drunk pictures\n'Cause Hennessy mixed with a whole bunch of buddah (Yup!)\nEquals you mixed with a whole bunch of Luda (Haha!)\nAnd you know how far one drink could go\nStart slurring my speech, slowing up the flow\nHiking up your skirts, climbing up your shirts\nIt's Mr. Late Night Luda, and I like to flirt\nSo guess what, baby girl!\n[Hook: T-Pain & Ludacris]\nYeah, yeah\nIf I take one more drink (Drink)\nI'm gon' end up fucking you (Just one more!)\nIs that what you wanna do, shawty?\nThat's all it's gon' take!\nIf I take one more drink (Hey!)\nI'm gon' end up fucking you\nHaha! Who else, T-Pain?\nYou too, ooh, ooh, ooooh\n\n[Outro: Ludacris]\nHahaha!\nYou hear what I'm saying?\nPeople too picky these days, dammit!\n\"Too tall, too short, too fat, too skinny\"\nHave a couple of drinks and quit discriminating\nThis has been a Luda Service Announcement\nDeuces!\nHahahaha5Embed"

I mean, how did he think of that?\nI mean, how did I think of that? Now, like a rental, bring it back\nI mean, how did I think of that?

Cause I'm still the champ in the South?\nCause rappers get in the booth and I keep draggin em out?\nWell they're fired, and these pink slips, I'm handin em out\nCause this is \"Theater of the Mind,\" consider it a sign\nOf what's to come next, my money's just fine\nBank filled with dumb checks, terrorist threat flow\nProceed to drop bombs like Mr. Funk Flex\nBut I don't do it for the money, I do it from the heart\nI do it with the beat box, I did it from the start\nI do it for the dee jays, I do it for the charts\nThe Van Gogh flow, Luda do it cause it's art\nI do it for the fans, I do it on command\nI do it for the front row, I do it for the stands\nI spit it for the hood, I do it for the block\nAnd since nine years old I did it for hip-hop, so\n[Chorus 1: Ludacris]\nI don't do it for them cars and the fancy drops\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\nAnd I don't it for the chains and the flashin rocks\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\n\n[Verse 2: Nas]\nUhh, uhh, uh\nThey say I'm so low key, I'm socially awkward\nOnly niggas who really know me, who I talk with\nThey smile in the light, hate in the dark\nYou call it beef, to me, it's just a fuckin walk in the park\nCause you are who you are when nobody's lookin\nThat's who you are, so when the cash and the cars is gone\nThe day after tomorrow, don't be askin to borrow\nSki mask it hard, like the way you rap in your bars\nI can ride on you and whoever, devise new endeavors\nI'm as live as a hive full of predators\nTwenty thousand different species of bees\nSome have poisonous stings, some just pollinate leaves\nIt's like rap, some just buzz, some will attack\nCompromise their own life in fact\nSixteen years since my first sixteen\nPardon the rest of my niggas... but I'm the best who's ever did it!\nYou might also like[Chorus 2: Ludacris, Nas, Ludacris & Nas]\nI don\u2019t do for the cars and the fancy drops\nUh, I do it for hip-hop\nYeah, I do it for hip-hop\nUh, I do it for hip-hop\nAnd I don\u2019t do for the chains and the flashin\u2019 rocks\nWhy we do it kid? I do it for hip-hop\nYeah, I do it for hip-hop\nUh, I do it for hip-hop\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z]\nHip-hop, started out in the park\nWe used to do it to avoid the Narcs\nI used to do it so the homeboy Clark\nCan get the fuck off my back while I knocked off these packs\nI used to rap to impress my friends\nTo pass the time while I was gettin' it in\nJust so happens, I'm so illegal with the pen\nThey ain't want me doin' anything illegal again\nI lost a lot of dogs to these streets\nI got Grammy Awards on these beats\nThank God for Kool Herc\nWithout your shit I probably would've got murked\nShout out to Grandmaster Flash and to Caz\nAnd even Jaz bum-ass\nHip-hop helped me wash my rocks\nThese other rappers couldn't wash my socks\nThat's why I took the number one slot\nThe realest shit in rap comes from my voice box\nLord knows when I was on my clock\nI prolly never woulda stopped, thank God for hip-hop\n[Chorus 3: Ludacris, Jay-Z, Ludacris, Nas & Jay-Z]\nI don\u2019t do for the cars and the fancy drops\nUh, I do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\nAnd I don\u2019t do for the chains and the flashin\u2019 rocks\nCome on, I do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\n\n{*DJ scratches and Ludacris ad-libs until 4:56*}\n\n[Chorus 1: Ludacris]\nI don't do it for them cars and the fancy drops\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\nAnd I don't it for the chains and the flashin rocks\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop\nI do it for hip-hop6Embed"

Salt with no Pepa\nEven the Eagles broke up and got the fuck back together!\nSellin millions of copies, and gettin that cash\nAnd Raz B said Chris Stokes was gettin that ass\nI don't even understand it, what the hell went wrong?\nMaybe folks'll wise up and take heed to this song, because\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Ludacris]\nI can't take it, no!\n\nAt first Wu-Tang broke up, now O.D.B. is gone\nThen I'm hearin Cam'Ron don't talk to Jim Jones?\nWho'da saw that shit comin? Certainly not me\nOr the Dogg Pound break up, or Goodie Mo-B\nThen Shawnna almost jumped ship from D.T.P\nIf Chingy left and came back then damnit, why can't she?\nWe gotta think it's all for one, and one for all\nHIP-HOP! United we stand, divided we fall\nSo why is\n[Hook] - repeat to fade w/ ad libsEmbed"

I mean how did he think of that?\nI mean how did I think of that? Now like a rental, bring it back\nI mean how did I think of that? I surprise myself sometimes\nSomeone should throw me a surprise party for every rhyme\nEvery time I do it, I do it dirty like swine\nFor the dirty and fine, hip-hop, I'm alive!\nYou might also like[Hook Two: Lil Wayne, Ludacris] {w/ scratches by DJ Jaycee}\n[W] I'm a lyricist to the death and I got what you need\n[W] Weezy F, the last of a dyin breed\n[W] And we almost extinct, so I'm sayin it loud\n[L] Say it with me {*\"MC means move the crowd\" - Rakim*}\n[L] Say it with me {*\"MC means move the crowd\" - Rakim*}\n[L] Say it with me! {*\"MC means move the crowd\" - Rakim*}\n{*scratches: \"M-MC means move, means move... m-move... move the crowd\"*}\n\n[Verse 3: Ludacris]\nThis is music Musclemania, my verse is on steroids\nPrivate planes, I'm on the jet, son, like Elroy\nFlying through the sky at amazing speeds\nWe on that Superman kush or that amazing weed\nThe new Bentley came out, my team said, \"Luda, get it!\"\n20 thou' says that I'm the only nigga wit it!\nNew Era on yo' brain like a A-town fitted\nAnd I'm not E-40 but I'm so Sick Wid It\nThat my flow got the flu, hoes I got a few\nBut I'm stingy with the dough, I'm like \"No not for you!\"\nWhat the fuck was you thinkin, off what I'm thinkin\nMe and Wayne on that lean, what the FUCK was you drinkin?\nStinkin like a dead body off in the woods\nSo I snatched her like a weave comin off in the hood\nAnd if you down for no bad, then we up to no good\nAnd it's important that you make it understood\n[Hook One]Embed"
