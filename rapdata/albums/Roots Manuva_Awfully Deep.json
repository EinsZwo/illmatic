God's my body guard, beg you pardon me, pa\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nMy sanity's back on the line again\nLast year, I said I wouldn't rhyme again\nBut I'm, back for punishment, time again\nIf I should lose my good mind again\nTell my management not to waste good money\nSendin' me away to the farms of the funny\nThem places only make me worse\nThey full'a, crooked doctors and kinky nurses\nThat poke you in the arse, and measure your schlong\nPut that tape measure down, that practice is wrong\nThey thought I didn't know what was goin' on\nBut I, knew the clue although the drugs was strong\nClaw-polma, oxidisa-what?\nTell me doctor, why I got purple snot\nI'm feelin' happy when I know I'm sad\nAnd now they wanna certify me mad\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThey said, \"Mr Smith, please calm down\nWe're not here to hurt you\nYou're feeling a little bit paranoid\nYour brain is over-heating\nYou're overworked, you're underpaid\nAnd your body's taken a beating\"\nAnd I said \"You're not seein' things, like how I'm seein' things\nI'm seein' things that I don't wanna see\nI see the devil sit right before me\nFire in his eyes as he spoke to me\"\nBlinked, I blinked and I pinched myself\nI screamed for Jesus but it was no use\nI had to face my, (awful) painful truth\nVoodoo in the hills, and I'm runnin' from ghosties\nLightin' up the candles as the spooks approach me\nVoodoo in the hills, and I'm runnin' from ghosties\nYou might also like[Hook]Embed"

A new-tical movement\nBringing improvement to mind and soul\nLife's a bitch, we tired of the bitching\nThem cheap escape routes got me here twitching\nHow much money must we waste 'til we see\nThem self-made hells that we make for ourself\nGoodbye old me, say hello to the new\nPlease Lord Jesus, help me get through\nCan I be a man for my baby boo\nWhat's a grown man supposedly to do\nWhen the world at large be scared of the truth\nI got good reason to be uncouth\nLike a big wide hole in the top of your roof\nAnd I really don't got much nice to say\nWhen day-to-day is pure bills to pay\nSo how am I supposed to change my ways\nWhen this world at large seems to lead me astray?\nYou might also like[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 3]\nTransfixed by an apparent\nWill and a way\nTo seize the day\nAccept us to social fray\nMost aware of what the media push\nThere goes the crooks who fiddle the books and\nRun scot-free 'cause money reigns supreme\nIn the gene of the fiends\nChemical warfare\nBiological warfare\nThat is never seen\nMan and machine\nGetting into things while\nSome claim road and some claim blame\nOblivious to the time that we're living in\nThe misled mislead\nAfflicted by the greed\nGovernment man keep fighting down the weed\nWhile they boost up the booze, the Prozac and methadone\nUse the taxpayer's money to develop they clones\nMisinformation\nMass sedation\nNations baited for spiritual rapings\n[Chorus  x 2]2Embed"

Who's the bigger fool?\nRoad rage, pavement rage, all kinds of rage\nYou're lucky if you get to see some old age\nEvery other day's a good day to die\nBest be careful, if you's love your life\nYou don't know nothin', you don't see nothin'\nYou don't be nothin', you don't do nothin'\nBut we all got to be something, and somebody\nBut everybody here can't be that rich\nYou know the sayin' - \"Life's a bitch\"\nI got my finger on the trigger with a nervous twitch\nKeep your mouth shut, help me dig this ditch\nDon't you be, a stupid bitch\n\n[Verse 3]\nI took a blunt knife, and cut a piece of my heart\nThat's my sacrifice, my wayward device\nIt sound mad though, my self-mutilation like\nDoctor Foster and his very first patients\nGod's unhappy cause we man's praisin' himself\nPlannin' to get to heaven with that earthly wealth\nBlood money, grudge money, no-body budge money\nMass futility, souls on the guillotine\nMeantime I unravel, callin' Jimmy Saville\n\"Come fix my epitome, I bid to leave this bitterness\"You might also likeEmbed"
