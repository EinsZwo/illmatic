If you ain't got a burner it's long\nYou don't want to see the aftermath\nAnd I ain't talkin about the label Curtis is on\nThis ain't just a verse in a song\nI buss two and put you in your hearse, then I'm gone\n\n[Hook: Kano & Ghetto]\nI'm a ghetto kid\nI swear I'm just a ghetto kid\nCause I'm a ghetto kid\nI swear Im just a ghetto kid\n(And that's why everywhere that we go I'm so ghetto they banned me from Heathrow)Embed"

I got a gang with me\nAnd we all walk with a gangster lean\nYou're all talk, you don't wanna ramp with me\nThere's no jokes or no pranks with me\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nIf you see me and I ain't with my crew\nBelieve I'm on my P's and Q's\nEven on my own two\nThat's the difference between me and you\nIf you see me and I ain't with my crew\nBelieve I'm on my P's and Q's\nEven on my own two\nThat's the difference between me and you\n\n[Verse 3]\nIf you see me and I ain't with my crew\nBelieve I'm on my P's and Q's, in sneaks or shoes\nWe're in a Honda, fuck it, no Jeeps and coupes\nWe'll chief your crew, we're so hungry, we'll teef your food\nSo mind out before you find out who you're speaking to\nI speak to youths on a level, and speak the truth\nSo please, there's thug in me\nBut there ain't no me in you\nAnd please, you ain't bussing one, let alone squeezing two\nSay cheese, but it won't be a snapshot\nPull out and try and hit like the jackpot, leave\nI ain't waiting around, baiting the town for Kane to be found\nThat's slipping\nIf there ain't a blitz between the clique\nThat's slipping\nNo whip, out the manor linking chicks?\nThat's slipping, that's slipping\n[Chorus]\nIf you see me and I ain't with my crew\nBelieve I'm on my P's and Q's\nEven on my own two\nThat's the difference between me and you\nIf you see me and I ain't with my crew\nBelieve I'm on my P's and Q's\nEven on my own two\nThat's the difference between me and you10Embed"

Fuck that, I'm taking time\nWe speak from like 8 till late at night\nWhen we gets on top, drop my favourite line (girl I ain't going nowhere)\nYou might also like[Kano Speaking]\nI plain ain't going nowhere\nBut, I like you, and it might take some time\nBut really I'm like\n[Leo The Lion & Kano]\nHere we go again\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Kano]\nI call her sometimes, and I wake her up at some dumb times\nTouch my phone and her number my thumb finds\nCos shes ideal like a nice meal, and a night in with a nice film\nMaybe some wine, maybe sometime we could\nHold hands in the park in the sunshine\nBe patient with me if I've got three raves in a week\nOr in the studio away for a week\nOne day we can book a vacation and leave\nBut please, no drama\nI don't need beef like Shane, Forbe, Fabian and Dean\nI'm just focused on making the peas\nBraking the team, chasing the dream\nI ain't on the street, maybe sometimes\nBut you can't say I don't make enough time\nWe speak every day and meet every week\nBut I don't know maybe its me\nYou got it planned out\nI don't make plans\nYou know me I wait and I see\nBut if we were together or even now if we weren't sort of, but were together\nWould you be faithful to me, treat me with a sarnie and make me a tea\nCome link me late, wake up from sleep and still look hot like 80 degrees\n[Leo The Lion]\nAnd you know I never say that sort of thing\n\n[Kano Speaking]\nSee? That's an angel to me\nI wouldn't have said that before, you get me?\nLike... she's making me weak\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Leo The Lion]\nNo, no, no, no, no, no\nOh my, my, ow\nBaby we could do this again sometime\nI even had a special name for you\nIt's 'Long Baby', cos you always on my mind, yeah\nI'll tell you straight, so straight, yeah\nI won't tell my mates (won't tell my mates)\nNo, no, I know, No, I know\nYeah I like you baby\nHere we go\nHere we go again\nHere we\nHere we go again3Embed"

K-A \u2026 I knew that\nAnd I know its not easy, and I know what you're feeling\nJust believe me\nYou might also like[Hook: Kano]\n\n\n[Verse 3: Kano]\nThat's why I don't feel I'm safe\nI fear I'm bait, but I can't put my skills to waste\nBecause if you're living by the gun you surely will get blazed\nI still don't blaze, refuse to smoke my life away\nRefuse to die before I try then put the mic away\nThis life of K, is just one big hype for praise\nWrite, night, record then start to write again\nBut I'm just saying, back on hype of Kane\nBut only I'm to blame\nToday I saw the signs again, and it's not a good look\nBut \"that's life\" they say, crime pays\nAnd I'll stop crime whenever this grime decides to pay\nBut grime ain't making me meals\nSo I'm picking up a 9 today\nAnd spitting ain't getting me deals\nBut this shits just getting real\n\n[Hook: Kano]\n\n[Outro: Kano]\nThis shits just getting real...
