No\nBut shit was movin slow, I had to switch machines up\nDestiny don't always match with the shit you dreamed up\nBut Bubba ain't no cream puff\nIn my life, I've seen much\nHeld the thrills and the spills\nThrough it all, I kept it trill\nGuarantee I never will ever feel as helpless\nAs I did these last couple years, I know you felt this\nReally don't expect no forgiveness for \"Deliverance\"\nThen again I offer no apologies, I meant the shit\nCause I lived the shit, truth is truth and that's the end of it\nI'm up and runnin, bet my jersey's in the rafters when I sit\nWatched it when I get a hit, everybody benefits\nI'm far removed from innocence, a year older than twenty-six\nPussy just remember this, I ain't chose the path I'm on\nIf you want it, come and get it, as that man I stand alone (oh!)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3 - Bubba Sparxxx]\nDuddy! Haha\nUh huh, hey say, hey let the guns play\nI just came with \"Me, Myself, and I\" like Beyonce\nLet these suckers run they coffee coolers, I'm the truest\nCountry motherfucker, bust and kill the talk, it's time to do it\nEverything your idol do it, I can do it cock eyed\nThree albums supplied, once I have not lied\nThat should mean a lot right?\nMaybe when they open up the books, I can get a look\nYou must admit, I'm dope as fuck, true I ain't devoted much\nOf my raps to dope, I'm just a little to preoccupied with the truth, you know what's up\nSorry but I know this much, Bubba K is sen-sat-ional\nThat shit ain't no bull\nAin't no bull that I can't pull, I am him\nThat'll be the case, if I'm ridin rims or shinin them\nBubba baby, more trouble baby, ha I love you hate me\nAsk your lady, is it maybe her that I've been pluggin lately\nFucker (*echo*)You might also likeEmbed"

I wasn't able to go through with it\"\nNo you didn't, how could you? Wait a minute, that makes you what?\n3 months and some change, well baby doll that just ain't enough\nTo derail us cuz see, that just means there's three of us\nBut answer this, at what point did you think this topic should be discussed?\nI don't know whether to cry or smile, but somehow I'm doin both\nBut this changes nothin, I got 2 babies and I solemnly swear to be true to both, baby!\n\n[Hook]\nYou might also like[Bridge - Frankie J]\nI wanna run, wanna run away\nThere's nothin they can do or say to make us stay\nI wanna run, wanna run away\nThere's nothin they can't do, there's nothin they can't say\nI wanna run, wanna run away\nOhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\nI wanna run, wanna run away\nI wanna run away, baby\n\n[Hook]Embed"
