Oh!\n\n[Chorus: Showtyme]\nSaid, it's my desire, yes, it is, yeah\nYes, it is, yes, it is, oh, yes, it is, ugh\n\n[Verse 1: Pharaohe Monch]\nComprehend the guidelines\nMy chest out, chinchilla, all relaxed on the sidelines\nI'm so famous, understand\nNew York City respect my game like Joe Namath\nAnd I protect my name like your anus\nIn prison, y'all don't hear me, y'all don't listen\nY'all just wanna shine, y'all just wanna glisten\nFloss, knowing that the soul is still missing\n(Who am I?) I'm the poetical pastor\nSlave to a label, but I own my masters\nStill get it poppin' without artists and repertoire\n'Cause Monch is a monarch, only minus the A&R\nWhen my brain excels, your train derails\nPop shit, make you feel The Clipse like Pharrell (Woo!)\nYou will feel me, you will admire\n(My) Struggle, (My) hustle, (My) sole desire\n[Chorus: Showtyme, M.O.P. sample]\nOoh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ah\nSaid, it's my desire\nYes it is, yeah, yeah\nOh! (Oh!) Oh! (Oh!)\nOh! (Oh!) Oh!\nSaid, it's my desire (Hey, hey-yeah, yeah-yeah)\n\n[Verse 2: Pharaohe Monch]\nMy book is a ovary, the pages I lust to turn\nMy pen is the penis, when I write, the ink is the sperm\nDesire, the fire that ignites the torch to burn\n(This is not rocket science) This is easy to learn\nMy mic's the gavel; when I talk, court's adjourned\nRespect, even if you was ashes, you couldn't earn\nI embody antibiotics, you are infected with germs\nRap's fatally ill, please, get concerned\nPlayers pick turns to play, get burned\nI color commentate the game like Chick Hearns\nThis is the moment of truth for my opponents and liars\nVocals alone invoke the emotion of Black choirs\nFire, you don't wanna get burned like Rich Pryor\nMove back, who's that there? The live-wire\nYou will feel me, you will admire\n(My) Struggle, (My) hustle, (My) sole desire\nYou might also like[Chorus: Showtyme]\nOoh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah\nSaid, it's my desire\nYes, it is, yeah-ah-ah-ah\n\n[Outro: Showtyme & MeLa Machinko, M.O.P. sample]\nIt's my desire\nKeep pushin', keep strivin' (My-y, y-y-y, oh-oh)\nMy passion, my fire\nThat's my desire\nI keep pushin', I keep strivin'\nOh! (Oh!) Oh! (Oh!)\nOh! (Oh!) Oh! (Oh!)\nThat's my desire\nKeep pushin', keep strivin'\nOh! (Oh!) Oh! (Oh!)\nOh! (Oh!) Oh! (Oh!) Oh!\nThat's my desire\nKeep pushin', I keep strivin'\nOh! (Oh!) Oh!

I said, \"Never\"\nMy mind's too sharp, my brain's too clever\nMy spine is too strong, every line pulls your lever\nLimitless rhymes for the indigenous, the remedy\nPlot \u2014 gettin' my money like the Kennedys\nFlip it \u2014 put em' in stocks, collect indemnities\nRock \u2014 roll, behold my epiphanies, and\nRead 'em and weep, heat 'em, I beat 'em to sleep\nMislead 'em til we even Steven, defeat 'em with freedom of speech\nAnd let 'em know that I'm the motherfuckin' fire-starter\nPiss on the Constitution, then burn the Magna Carta\n[Chorus]\nAll I know is what I feel\nDeceive my eyes and distort what's real\nOnly truth will set you free\nI'd rather die on my feet than to live on my knees\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe dying over black gold, they harvesting the sand\nPresidents living marvelous, they starving in Sudan\nIt's obvious you walk a blind path to oblivion\nThe book of judges read the scriptures unlike Gideon\nLight my fire, start my engine\nWhen Pharoahe becomes Moses, it's medicine for who listens\nA veteran with a mic bringing prophecies to fruition\nMotivational verses under adverse conditions\nYou're caught in the mainframe, I've seen the maze, man\nThey watch you from the street lights, you and your main man\nThe bar code around your neck same as your name brand\nYou're lost in a strange land, no thoughts of a game plan\n\n[Chorus]\nAll I know is what I feel\nDeceive my eyes and distort what's real\nOnly truth will set you free\nI'd rather die on my feet than to live on my knees\nYou might also like[Outro]\nPiss on the Constitution, then burn the Magna Carta\nPiss on the Constitution, then burn the Magna Carta\nPiss on the Constitution, then burn the Magna Carta\nPiss on the Constitution, then burn the Magna Carta\nPiss on the Constitution, then burn the Magna Carta\nPiss on the Constitution, then burn the Magna Carta\nPiss on the Constitution, then burn the Magna Carta\nPiss on the Constitution, then burn the Magna Carta, Carta, Carta1Embed"
