You better believe the nigga kept girl fond\nThe name's Bond!\n[Verse 2]\nWell, I'm outside and it's the chief with twenty thieves like the Brainiac\nBeware because the Double 0 was bucking like a maniac\nTill nobody lives, so hon, nowhere to do correct\nSaid \"excuse me baby, but where they hiding the hooker at?\"\n\"Around the block, but chill at least chill till the storm has stopped\"\nDecided it was a helicopter, sounds like its warming up\nGrabbed ya leg, shot the chief, someone said \"Stop hawking\"\nShook me off at twenty-thou, the Bond got up walking\nThey was laughing as they left they grew thinner like Iraqi\nGot the plans from the dying chief of police in her pocket\nTo make it even worse honey girl was definitely rattin'\nWas holding her in a club that was happening in Manhattan\nI'm on the plane in the day seemed nothing was a phasing\nExcept for the stewardess jocking the Amazing\nBut kept my composure, had another honey hon\nWho the Don? You better believe a nigga kept girl fond\nThe name's Bond!\n\n[Verse 3]\nBack at home in New York, I didn't want to get too overfly\nYou wanna know why I pulled out my 535i? (pimp!)\nBoy I see some lookouts with some girls that was annoyed\nIt was a private engagement for the dealer and the boys\nDouble just passed the hoods with their faces painted\nWalked in, say a good twenty girls fainted\nThrow cousins all out but seems that everyone was shitting\nAnd man I was so cool I even carried me a kitten (reowr!)\nTrouble for the Double 0? Wouldn't swallow that\nWho's the man with the golden gun and all of that\nTurned curls of mercy, left blood on the walls of\nRescued the shorty who was all on the balls of\nWhore said \"You're late!\" I don't wanna hear none of your dissing\nNabbed the cash, made a good twenty million for the mission\nGood job, not to mention had the boss honey hung\nSo who's a Don? Better believe a nigga kept girl fond\nThe name's Bond!You might also likeEmbed"
