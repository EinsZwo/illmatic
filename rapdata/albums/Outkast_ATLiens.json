Col' people, who caboose my locomotive\nBut enough of that, everyone can rap but let's say gift, suppose if\nI use my gift of gab to boast and brag in every rhyme I\nCompose, won't y'all get sick of that, 'cause I know I do when I hear those\nFlows that ain't hip-hop, you find that shit in the gift shop\nBut to each his own, my speech is born\nKeep that shit up outta my zone\nLong as you happy, then I'm happy\nEven if you just hate my fucking guts, go 'head and dap me\n'Cause I'm gon' dap you anyway\nAnd then go home and pray for your ass later\n'Cause we might need you in this war, I'm wailing on you traitors\nLike thatYou might also like7Embed"

provoking, spoken\nWords of a change I don't feel but I see\nVisions from me at 23\nMaking it free in my community\nOne day is what I live for\nAin't thinking about no hope no more\nI got my boots I kick it 'til I get with\nAdapt and overcome, oh hum hum\nGo get my gun, load up for fun, and put down with the frown\nWhat goes round comes round from M.L.K. to Cascade\nI know it's through them plenty figures\nCocaine dealers walk the wrong side\nUp in they rides\nLooking cleaner then I seen them the last time\nThen selling dimes, now its quarter ki's, stacking G's\nIn the South Indies\nMy nigga them folks riding bicycles among vehicles\nOff in the hood\nKnowing each and every nigga selling, but can you blame\nThe fact the only way a brother can survive the game\nThe block hard to get by the dope dealing\nFatal killings, and fed time, to writing rhymes\nIt ain't just the police\nWe kill each other just lost another brother\nFast living will get you took\nThinking it can't happen to you and then it do\nOff crooked schemes it's just a dream\nFloating face down in the mainstream\n[Hook: Khujo Goodie]\nThink it is when it ain't all peaches and cream\nThat's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream\n\n[Verse 2: Andr\u00e9 3000]\nThey swan diving\nAs if they name be Gretchen von Ivan\nVolkoff rushin' to finish their album then you find them\nLost dog paddling, backstroking, what done happened?\nBe rhyming \"catch of the day\" when the recipe calls for \"blackened\"\nWrong ingredients\nMaybe too much herbs and spices\nMaybe you got hungry for the wrong dish\nOf them greens and it's enticing how them Jones's sing\nSo I'm gonna sing just like them to get where they at\nI'll even break my by back to touch their rim, if I gotta\nMy alta mater be that I follow\nI bite whatever that's looking tasty, water it down and then swallow\nI hope you vomit, won't call no names cause that's not my job\nIt just applies to whom it may concern, you know who you are\nBut if you don't you never will, you just receive the steel\nBut then it might get ugly 'cause trust me niggas do feel\nThe way that I felt when I wrote this, but we must stay in focus\nWe kings and queens up in this thing, get rid of all them jokers\nFace down, face down, face down\nYou might also like[Hook: Khujo Goodie]\nThink it is when it ain't all peaches and cream\nThat's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream\n\n[Verse 3: Khujo Goodie]\nI let you stay in my crib\nNow you know where I live\nWhen you was hungry, fed you a hot meal\nLook at the hand you deal\nMe crudball business, niggas giving inches, so here, take a foot\nLuck only counts in rabbit's feet and horseshoes\nExperience is sometimes the best teacher until we get our own plate\nI hope you don't mind me eating off of yours\nProcess sm-m-moking like Jerry\nMeanwhile, fairies up the street sprinkling pixie dust over greenery\nNever to attain another level of conscience\nOnly to test, the potency\nWhy laying here, they scheme over one another mouth to feed\nDeceased with a decision to make, now words shake your destiny\nBut one miss will take it all the way, just as quick as you can say\n\"I wish I never did what I did,\" now face this bid\nIt was the company you kept, the many places you slept\nWhen you shouldn't have, geeking like a rat, jumping like a trap\nContributing to sin and your nigga bitch in the club showing pink for 10\nThey got you niggas where they want you again\nFloating face down in the mainstream\nThat's why, that's why, that's why\n[Hook: Khujo Goodie]\nThink it is when it ain't all peaches and cream\nThat's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream\n\n[Verse 4: Big Boi]\nEverybody's a player, wearing them Kangols on their head\nThinking it's all about your clothes, nigga, it's all about your self\nThe way you feel about your life, the times that you done shared with\nYour friends and family, up and down like hoes give head\nTo dicks, oh, six, serving them in the mix, but ain't no mystery\nYou know the history about this clique, bitch\nOh, what, you want me to call you slut?\nThen why you fucking all them niggas letting them all up in your guts\nBut see that AIDS I'm afraid that's why I play the quiet role\nI lay in the cut, every month thinking I'll let that fire roll\nLike chimneys, and smoke signals, maybe peace pipes even\nMy partners call me Big Boi and my first name is not Steven\nIn the mainstream, home team banging them with these hits\nIn the mix, flowing like some motherfucking swordfish\n\n[Hook: Khujo Goodie]\nThink it is when it ain't all peaches and cream\nThat's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream\nThink it is when it ain't all peaches and cream\nThat's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream\nThink it is when it ain't all peaches and cream\nThat's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream\nThink it is when it ain't all peaches and cream\nThat's why some are found floating face down in the mainstream7Embed"

Cause in a sense see we all be kind of fly\nJust can't be scared to spread your wings, head to better things\nMaybe the mockingbird and nightingale they want to sing\nKeeping this thing alive, to the table's what we bring\nWe like hailstorms and blizzards in the middle of the spring\nExtraterrestrial, out of this world\nYou might also like[Hook]\nOut of this world\nAre you alien?\nOut of this world\nAre you alien?\nOut of this world\nAre you alien?\nOut of this world2Embed"
