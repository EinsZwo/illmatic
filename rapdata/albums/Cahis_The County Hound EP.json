Ramone shot\nFuck a Ca$his momma! Ramone shot\nIt started as a fight, on a distant night\nBut far off the homicide, pistols tight\nWe still... grieve over your brother\nNow you, grieve over your son - what the fuck?\nHe squabbed me up, this my hood\nSome nigga named Ca$his from Chris' hood\nHe supposed to come back with iron, I ain't scared\nYes I am momma, I don't wanna be dead\nBut I can't run; too late, to try and change it\nBorn as your son but dyin as a banger\nWhen my name gets discussed for entertainment\nNever share this letter with a stranger\nPlease, please\n[Hook] + [Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nDear Brian, it's Ca$his, I can't sleep\nI had to bang you, before you bang me\nJust like I blame you, you could blame me\nWe both gave up our lives for banging (yeah)\nWe didn't know each other but we share the same hate\nYour death is my life, so we share the same fate\nThis ain't what bangin was for, killin for nothin\nYour death gave karma for the death of my woman (Monique!)\nI'm tryin to make amends cause within I'm croak\nBut outside I'm hard, my friends don't know\nI'm sorry that I killed you, I know it don't mean shit\nWe both could've stopped it, if we only seen shit\nHappens for a reason we don't even know it\nWhen you leave here, do you know where you goin?\nI'm sendin my apologies through a song\nMaybe we can reconcile when I'm gone\n\n[Hook] + [Hook]Embed"
