What's the deal y'all?\nI need y'all niggas to buckle up one time\nFasten your seatbelts, I'ma take y'all on some real shit\nThis Theodore shit, y'all niggas know what time it is and shit\nY'know I mean? It's real motherfuckin' shit, you know\n\n[Verse: Ghostface Killah]\nYo, making moves back and forth uptown\n60 dollars plus toll is the cab fee\nWintertime bubble goose, goose, clouds of smoke\nMusic blastin' and the Arab V blunted\nWhip smelling like fish from 125th\nThrowin' ketchup on my fries, hitting baseball spliffs\nBack seat with my leg all stiff\nPush the fuckin' seat up, tartar sauce on my S Dot kicks\nRocks is lit while I'm poppin' the clips\nI'm ready for war, got to call the Cuban guys\nGot the Montana booth in front of the store\nMade my usual gun check, safety off, come on Frank\nThe moment is here, take your fuckin' hood off\nAnd tell the driver to stay put\nFuck them niggas on the block they shook, most of them won't look\nThey frontin', they no crooks they fuck up they own jux\nLook out for Jackson 5-0 'cause they on foot\nStraight ahead is the doorway, see that lady with the shopping cart\nShe keep a shottie cocked in the hallway\nDamn she look pretty old Ghost\nShe work for Kevin, she 'bout 77\nShe paid her dues when she smoked his brother in law at his bosses' wedding\nFlew to Venezuela quickly when the big fed stepped in\n3 o'clock, watch the kids, third floor, last door\nYou look paranoid that's why I can't juks with you\nWhy? Why you behind me leery?\nShakey Dog stutterin', when you got the bigger cooker on you\nYou is a crazy motherfucker, small Hoodie dude\nHilarious move, you on some Curly, Moe, Larry shit\nStraight parry shit, Krispy Kreme\nCocaine, dead bodies, jail time you goin' carry it\nMatter of fact, all the cash, I'ma carry it\nStash it in jelly and break it down at the Marriott\nThis is the spot, yo son your burner cocked?\nThese fuckin' maricons on the couch watchin' Sanford and Son\nPassin' they rum, fried plantains and rice, big round onions on a T-bone steak\nMy stomach growling, yo I want some\nHold on, somebody's comin', get behind me, knock at the door\nAct like you stickin' me up, put the joint to my face\nPush me in quickly when the bitch open up\nRemember you don't know me, blast him if he reach for his gun\nYo who goes there? Tony, Tony one second homie\nNo matter rain, sleet or snow you know you supposed to phone me\nOff came the latch, Frank pushed me into the door\nThe door flew open, dude had his mouth open\nFrozen, stood still with his heat bulgin'\nTold him, \"Freeze!\" lay the fuck down and enjoy the moment\nFrank snatched his gat, slapped him, asked him\nWhere's the cash, coke and the crack? Get to smokin' you fast\nHis wife stood up speakin' in Spanish, big tittie bitch holdin' the cannon\nRan in the kitchen, threw a shot\nThe kick in the four-fifth broke a bone in her wrist\nAnd she dropped the heat, \"Give up the coke!\", but the bitch wouldn't listen\nI'm on the floor like, \"Holy shit!\", watchin' my man Frank get busy\nHe zoned out, finished off my man's wiz\nHe let the pitbull out, big head Bruno with the little shark's teeth chargin'\nFoamin' out the mouth, I'm scared\nFrank screamin', blowin' shots in the air\nMissin' his target, off the Frigidare, it grazed my ear\nKilled that bullshit pit, ran to the bathroom butt first\nFrank put two holes in the doorman's Sassoon\nThe coke's in the vacuum, got to the bathroom, faced his bad wounds\nThe big one had the centipede stab wound\nFrank shot the skinny dude, laid him out\nThe bigger dude popped Frankie boy, played him out\nTo be continued...You might also like6Embed"

hook for y'all niggas\nCheck it out...\n[Hook: Ghostface Killah]\nThe burners and the stash, we 'bout the cash\nWe got females that got it like that\nThe golden childs that bone the crowd\nSee, niggas in the place that bit my style\nWell, I'm a singer, dancer, we bulletproof brothers\nWu-Tang got the answer\nCause if I had a chance to do it again\nI will still keep the heat in my pants-uh\n\n[Verse 1: Ghostface Killah]\nY'all be nice to the crackheads, everybody listen up\nI shot one of my bitches, the ho ain't trick enough\nWord life to big screen Don, tapping dustbones out\nWith starwriters like I fucked Celine Dion\nStuck everything that's the god's honest beyond\nWe airin' niggas out, that's the type shit that we on\nOfficial Wu-Tang headbanger\nFlood your space with big waves like you did in Sri Lanka\n\n[Verse 2: Raekwon]\nI drink heavy gallons of cru, play the big part\nNiggas got squid on the grill, selling kids Clarks\nFinesse notes, yo, the Guess on with the vest pose\nYellow swede one matching hat with the grey gun\nNiggas be rhymin' for nothing, then my team pull up\nWe all throw down y'all broke niggas stay frontin'\nLines come digital stupid, plus ain't got no jewelry on\nBet I'm still live and I'm coopin'\nTwo of my silverbacks run through a pack of your wolves\nFront on react, we're sippin' Cognac [?] relax dude\nKnow I'm with these cracks dude\nYou might also

Cappadonna]\nIt's the return of Bin Laden, grab your armor\nSmash pretty boy niggas, crush their karma\nEat bones with alligators, roll deep with my entourage\nMy whole crew's fresh out the bars\nDiggler AKA the Cab Driver\nDrop him off in the middle of fire\nDirty Island, drag bodies to the Murderland\nKnock niggas out hurtin' my hand\n\n[Verse 5: Method Man]\nI remember in the elevator we was playin' corners\nNow we play the corners and the cops is stayin' on us\nStaten's where the war is\nWhere the court system's running out of warrants\nWhere TNT be jumping out the Taurus\nFor real I can't call it\nYou see I love Lucy cause she Lawless\nExactly like that 1-0-3-0-4 is\nSnitch niggas swallow your tongue\nAlready know the island I'm from\nAnd y'all don't want no problems with them\n[Verse 6: GZA]\nWe got a history full of lightning victories\nConceptual breakthrough, it ain't no mystery\nLong vision from giants in every way\nRap czars, magnificent flows for every day\nFrom the East to the 'ville, from the West to the hills\nIncredible rhymes, encouraging skills\nFrom rat packs, the smallest crews were enormous\nWe hit 'em fast with an effortless performance\nMCs start fleeing in flocks\nEspecially those that's more sensitive to heat and shock\n\n[Verse 7: Inspectah Deck]\nWe grindin' down to the bone, my name grounded in stone\nI'm Mr. Violence we loungin' with chrome\nMr. Violence we lounge in his home, hit the housing on Rome\nShining like a hundred thousand in stones\nMove mountains with poems, got a jones for dinero\n1-6-zero my songs we throwin' elbows\nThe hoes cling, sho thing, we know kings\nOnly dime dikes with minds right, we choose Queens\n\n[Verse 8: Masta Killa]\nYeah, we wild like rockstars who smash guitars\nYo, son, split his face with the toast, he ain't ghost\nIt's no joke iron coat rifle with the stroke\nOne toke brains float, shot to the throat\nBefore the smoke hit, witness the killing, chilling crime scene\nBody on the block, eyes open from the shock\nOf being popped in the neck\nYet he still held a lit cigarette between his fingers\nDanger when you step into the chamber with the Masta\nDisaster, gotta blast ya cause I have to\n\n[Verse 9: U-God]\nThe rat pack is back from the island of Stat'\nLeave you cursed dust, cause you worship the Gat\nThe first one to snap drunk off the Smirnoff\nBlow the bouncer's ear off, let him floss he the boss\nHandcuffed, to the turntables like Wizard Theodore\nSee it's pure, let it rain pearly ounces\nBang him with the thing that hang from the trousers\nYou don't want no drama, I'm flaming fast\nThat nigga jumped up and did the Damon Dash2Embed"

Fuck you too, nigga!\n'Kind of pants you got on motherfucker, Capris?!\nBitch ass nigga, go get ya feet done!\nEat a dick nigga!\n\n[Verse 1]\nCatch me in the 80's drop\nOld school Mercedes with a brand new baby Glock\nRight from my Lady's sock with two bodies on it\nCapricorn, Aquarius\nLost so much blood, these bitch niggas in they periods\nThey say I be living the role, like 'Pac in Juice\nAnd only fuck with cute bitches that can fly and boost\nAnd they ears be chandeliers, lit up like a lamp, Who cares?!\nThey cooch is fierce, the only thing loose is hairs\nThat's right y'all, if a rap nigga say my name I'm a fight y'all\nFuck a state, light charge\nMy predicate status, irrelevant\nMy man got the big rap sheet that's outweighing two elephants\nJumbo shits from New Orleans\nPlayers and Pimps that bit off Fiends\nQuick, switch with the hands, Powder blue wally's is dyed, Vanilla Bally's is mean\nCan't none of y'all motherfuckers fuck with my team, Uh!\n[Hook: Trife Da God]\nAiyyo we the live niggas holding heat on the street corners\nSic the beasts on you, turn mothers to mourners\nMoney launderers, neighborhood coroners, place bodies in bags\nTango with dirty Cash, Cocaine jacks\n\"Kings of the Hill\", out to blow like propane gas\nPackage the raw, Theodore, We got the game on smash\nCause we cut from the same cloth\nBig guns ready to bang off\nSlide off the cables and take the rings off!\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe hold the weight of four Synagogues\nJelly'd uptown in them beat down rented cars\nGoing mad wetting 'em\nMilk cash, heavy tecks, hood rats, sexing 'em\nParis crew, little dudes, please! I was repping 'em\nNiggas couldn't come through (word)\nThat's when the block was like wallpaper, loved sticking niggas like crazy glue\nBlackouts happened, God forbid don't be around!\nThe Bag Lady will murk you and let off in the next town!\nShe struck two times, get caught, good luck blood, it ain't no Heinz\nBlow a hockey puck hole in the back of your spine\nShe put two cut up mirrors in the place of your eyes\nSo when the cops look they see theyselves, they all gonna die\nIts the tale of the Crips and Bloods, pimps and thugs\nGet your face bashed in on the concrete rug\nOn that note I'm a say peace!\nTheodore! Word to Darryl Mack's teeth!\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nYo, Ayo I'll break every bone in your wrist\nSmack you in the back of your head on the block while you holding your dick\nMy semi, they call it the crouching tiger\nA hundred bowls of Total is trash, because my lead eat through fibers\nPeel your potato like Ore-Ida\nOn the day of your death people had candles but couldn't find no lighter\nFuck your mural! Fuck your hood!\nYou ain't a street legend like me!\nBlake Carrington holding the Dynasty\nI muffle motherfuckers up like Meineke\nAnd write a thousand bar verse that all rhymes with \"E\"\nJewel thief, Shizzam bangles, in the vault deep\nAnd cruising deserts mad heavy into salt treats\nI'm the taste in Bush's mouth, nasty\nAfghanistan missions, gun training in the grassy fatigues\nPicking niggas off by the Red Sea\nAnd did it all for Ghost, sniffing on caffeine!Embed"

I say \"fuck him\"\nAnd this one bitch called me Fat Albert\nThe way my pockets had the mumps, you know that Ghost is 'bout it\nThen I asked these young ladies do they buff helmets\nThey said \"fuck you\", took a sniff and then they didn't tell me\nJust because you left home, this is Tone\nYo, you see I flip stones\nBirthstone, you ain't grown fuck around and get boned\n3 rich pretty young ladies lost at 6, Gucci kicks\nAnd they picky when it come to they dick\nIf y'all ladies was all mine I'd teach you well\nFree tales, sweet smells, eat well, hear bells\nBefore you sleep, read your books like it was my fanmail\nAnd when you wake, you be a new woman, know the whole world can tell\nWord life, put you to school when the clubs'll stop\nCollege girl, pay for your books at 200 a pop\nAnd all I ask in life's for you to be careful\nStay focused, take care of your health\nHave kids and marry a prince\nGood luck and happiness\nAnd no longer shut yourself in, taste the pain, the sorrow\nThe sun'll shine and still come out tomorrow\nAnd maybe be a secretary, business woman, 5th Ave., or run a library\nYou got the right conversation, education and looks\nWith the right intelligence to stay away from them crooks\nBaby get on your feet, be an accountant, doctor, lawyer or nurses's aid\nComputer wizard, you about to get paid\n[Outro, over background singing]\nYea\nYou know I just met y'all\nAnd I love y'all already and all that\nBut I gotta get off that nose candy\nTo make it in life and all that shit\nThat's why I'm here\nI'm like a father figure and all that shit\nI let y'all get high, and that's all you're going to do but\nYa'nawm sayin?\nCause I drop jewels all over the place\nY'all too pretty for that\nSome of y'all nose hairs is burnt\nI just want you to snap out of it\nYou know why? cause you's aYou might also like5Embed"
