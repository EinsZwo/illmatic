Niggas is hoe believe me\nCome and get these hollow tips, my bullets got coppertini\n[Chorus: repeat 2X]\nA whole lot of niggas talk a whole lotta shit\nBut when it goes down they ain't fin' to do shit\nDo somethin, do somethin (DO ANYTHANG~!)\nDo somethin, do somethin (I MEAN ANYTHANG~!)\n\n[Gorilla Zoe]\nEven if you're sellin samples make a profit\nHoe you ain't makin nuttin? Huh, fuck nigga stop it\nIf you got it why not go on and cop it\nTalkin 'bout what you gon' do, nigga I think you poppin\nNiggas talk a lot, but they ain't real doe\nYou bitch made nigga grab a dildo\nHundred round draw and lean back, do the limbo\nYou're playin games with Donkey Kong on Nintendo\nI'm King Kong, silverback Congo\nCall me Gorilla but my real name 'Lonzo\nRunnin last set, 8 months and a fumble\nZoked you might be but big bro he head honcho\n\n[Chorus]\n\n[Gorilla Zoe]\nPuff some ad-libs, and fuck a rap\nI do it for my hood niggas in the fuckin trap\nWho's the king now? You the king of who?\nI'm a feral motherfucker, \"Welcome to the Zoo\"\nThis the third verse let's get to a conclusion\nImage is a smokescreen, these rappers are illusions\n(YEAH~!) There you go... I said it damn it\nIf you don't like, fuck ya nigga, go on do somethin to me\nI ain't fazed so they so causin repercussions\nDropped on your ass, try to do some reconstruction\nKiller for real gon' handle these niggas\nThe block is the Zoo and the world gon' feel us\nThese niggas can hate but these bitches gon' feel us\nI'm king of the jungle they call me Gorilla\nYou might also like[Chorus]\n\nDo somethin!Embed"
