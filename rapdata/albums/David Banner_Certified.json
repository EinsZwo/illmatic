Fuck the PD! Fuck em, bitch!)\nI'mma come to the crib, I'mma flood my block\nI'mma ride downtown yelling \"Fuck Trent Lott!\"\nThey done raped grandmama, they done took our land\nNow they wonder why a nigga don't give a hot damn\nDamn\nDamn\n\n[Chorus]\nThis is for my thug niggas, all the pimps and the drug dealers\nThieves and the muthafuckin killas (Save our souls)\nThe ones who ain't never had shit\nThat's why we get crunk in this bitch\nThis is for my thug niggas, all the pimps and the drug dealers\nThieves and the muthafuckin killas (Save our souls)\nThe ones who ain't never had shit\nThat's why we get crunk in this bitchEmbed"
