What's up. This is the O to the D to the M\nI like to say peace to all the crazy vatos out there\n[DTTX]\nAnd this is the D, double T-X and we came to correct our mistakes that was talked about the brown race\n\n[Fade Love]\nYo, this is DJ Fade Love and I like to say what's up to all my hente. Be brown and proud for the 90s and we out of here\n\nPaz, paz, paz...Embed"
