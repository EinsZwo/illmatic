Don't you know not to ever disturb a woman when she's cooking her favorite recipe?!\"\n\"Hey lady, look. This a jack move!\"\n\"Fried chicken, pork chop, chitlins, collard greens... What's wrong with you, eh? I have to get back to the kitchen. My cabbage is burning.\"\n\"Yeah, I want the cabbage and your collard greens. All of it. Right now.\"\n\"Besides, you're making me miss my favorite episode Fear Factor! I wonder if the ribs are done. You boys want to know chef's favorite recipe for musicals?\"\n\"I don't wanna know no chef recipe?! Go 'head. Get the pump! Gon' and get the pump.\"\n\"Well I tell you. You take a half a teaspoon of Mary J. and Ciara with a dash of Slick Rick.\"\n\"Yeah, yeah, he gon' come back with the burner. Yeah, I'mma stick-- Yeah... Okay. Well, you play. Play!\" \"I'm back. Oh I'm back!\" \"Now what now!\"\n\"It's easy as 1-2-3 play. Next, you mix Rhemario and Qu'ran in a Bangladesh style bowl to make some Nisan Stew(art). Mix some Campbell's soup...\"\n\"And then???\"\n\"...I prefer Warryn style myself personally, Add a pinch of Fantasia...\"\n\"And THEN???\"\n\"...with a Grand sized Puba, then you sprinkle one Scoop Fatman throughout to add flavor and a dab of Soul Diggaz\nThen you throw a tablespoon of Timbaland and half a Neptune smothered in hot Scott Storch dressing.\"\n\"We gon' smother you in some hot sauce. Whatever you said.\"\n\"...and you serve with a side order of Mike Jones.\"\n\"Mike Jones?\" \"Who?\" \"Mike Jones!\"\n\"It's best served with a cold St. Nick brew, whichever you prefer. And there you have it kiddies. This is my perfect recipe for a delicious meal.
