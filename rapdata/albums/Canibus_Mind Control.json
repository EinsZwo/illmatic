I use to say it just like that\nMaybe I should copyright that, I'll be right back\n(Pause)\nSorry to leave you hangin\nI write things down quick cuz I ain't takin no chances\nThats the difference between you and me\nYou a wanna-be, and I'm an MC\nI'm just in the booth right now\nI'm just kickin it with you right now\nI'm tellin you the truth right now\nYou can't fuck with the Canibus man, you can't fuck with the Canibus man\n[Canibus]\nNow in this rap field, I got a lot of confirmed kills\nI put niggas through drills to prove if they got true skills\nYou coulda sold millions, but if you ain't got 100 bars shut the fuck up\nAt least don't talk to me, cuz I ain't hearin you\nIf you that ill, give me a hundred bars, I'm darin you\nI definitely ain't scared of you\nI go to war cuz I'm prepared to lose\nJust as long as I get to damage you\nTake the mic from you, then put a knife in you\nThat's what I like to do, make you lose a pint or two\nIf you a lion I'm a tiger too\nI could be as nice as you, but if you a snake I'm a viper too\nLook you in the eyes and lie to you\nThinkin about all the possible ways to kill you while I smile at you\nYou like to get fly nigga I'm a pilot too\nDon't even try to get deep cuz I'm a diver too\nDon't try to fit in my shoes cuz you can't\nNobody can fuck with the Canibus man, understand?\n\n[Canibus]\nYo, yo, yo, my mouth is mechanically mechanized\nMy verbal weapon fires a whole clip of rhymes before you can get off one round\nCan-I-Bus will buss ya, apply enough pressure to crush ya, I pulverize mother fuckers\nLeave MC's laid out like hurricane debris, 15 Megatons of TNT\nThe overseas block busta, bustin up blocks like the Tiguska meteorite to hit Russia\nComin from the underground I discovered\nA ground underneath the ground before underground bunkers\nDedicate it's blunkers, deeper than the labrith\nConductin excavations of the matrix\nLiving in uninhabitable places, craters of a desert like oasis with a cydonian faces\nAs barren as Las Vegas, as barren as the wombs of women who use artificial insemination\nAs barren as Utah's Salt Lake City basin, as barren as ancient Egypt before irrigation\nA five-star chef makin mouth-watering creations with blood stains on my apron\nPut the heads of wack MC's in my oven and bake them\nThen garlic bread sticks in their eye sockets and taste them\nIt's not really that odd, when you consider part of the ancient culture loves to eat dogs\nFeline cats with their claws, paws and all\nCaucasians eat frogs, African-americans eat the hog\nHindus in India will kneel to the floor and worship cows and rats as gods\nI raise the odds, spit rhymes towards Mars and beyond to the nearest binary star\nI'mma tell you once more my main man, you can't fuck with the Canibus manYou might also likeEmbed"

Tell me, what's your age?\nYou got a man? Can we be friends?\"\nI'm glad you feel that way, come on and ride with me\nI take you to that Crunk bar where them sharks eat\nFive-star baby, bon-appetite\nI got that shrimp appetizer with that dog meat\nIf shorty want to creep, I bring her home with me\nJust bought some candles and that Carl Thomas CD\nBootleg that Jay-Z, stole that OutKast\nBeen have that Keith Sweat, I know how to make it last\nSmack that naked ass, she got a big butt\nI ain't in no rush, plus she likes it rough\nKinky stuff like, leather and handcuffs\nAnd them thangs you wrap around a man's you-know-what\nThat's why I love Atlanta, I can hardly stand-up\nI'm a heavy drinker, fix me a cup and sinker\nI always love Atlanta, that's why I love Atlanta\nI love my home Atlanta, I love my home Atlanta\n\n[Canibus]\nAs a young child I was so damn bad\nUsed to drive up the Ave with no tags\nNiggas couldn't see me, I was going so fast\nMost niggas catch whiplash and crash\nFace all chipped up from the glass\nRunning from the police hauling ass\nIf I get caught, I just give them some cash\nMost police give me dap and laugh\nOther ones pull up behind the flash\nTake a nightstick and tap the glass\nTell me, \"Turn the music down,\" it's on blast\nTurn the engine off cause I'm wasting gas\nTell them that I'm lost and I need a map\nLooking for a hotel to take a nap\nFreaknik, officer, I came for that\nIt was good last year that's why I'm back\nThat's when he tried to hit me\nHis big fist barely miss me\nI have my camera with me\nI think I'll sue the city\nI love this place Atlanta\nThat's why I love Atlanta\nI love my home Atlanta\nI love my home AtlantaYou might also likeEmbed"

talking that blah blah blah\nHa ha ha ha ha\nBut anyway, a regular day is just like this\nCanibus writes a rhyme then Canibus spits, Like\nHa ha ha ha ha\nI eat eat eat rhymes, Niggas don't be understanding that shit\nWhy you think I went and put a fucking mic on my arm\nCause it belongs to me and I belong next to Ghengis Khan\nIn a coffin carbon-dryed with my body in bronze\nLike Han Solo when he got frozen in Star Wars\nHa ha ha ha ha\nI'm great but I'm not the greatest\nHa ha ha ha ha\nI believe I'm God but I'm not atheist\nHa ha ha ha ha\nI'm crazy but I'm not the craziest\nI'm just a normal heterosexual Homo Sapien\nHa ha ha ha ha\nThe industry tried to cave me and I was an archangel\nBut they changed me into Damien\nHa ha ha ha ha\nThe evil spirit of rap, the evil rapper\nHa ha

know the Canibus is the one\nHa ha ha ha ha\nHa ha ha ha ha\nThe rhyme creator\nAt the drop of a dime I spit 100 b-a-rs\nI'm a S-T-A-R since the day I was born\nAnd I'll be a star til the day that I'm gone\nHa ha ha ha ha\nYou can agree with uh-huh or disagree with uh-uh\nWhatever, niggas can't front\nHa ha ha ha ha\nIf they respond too late to the 911 call\nThey find you on the floor with a razor blade in your palm\nDeep cuts an inch wide and 5 inches long\nParamedics feel for a pulse to see if you gone\nYou was pronounced D.O.A. before you got to E.R\nThe doctor swore that suicide was the probably cause\nProbably because, you weak insecure motherfuckers\nFeel lost when you hear me roar\nHa ha ha ha ha\nLike-uh the predator starring Schwartzenegger\nBefore he triggered the bomb he

infallible\nLet's not forget utterly impossible or\nMorally insurmountable to assume that I could lose if I battled you\nMy Scholastic Aptitude is 1602\n100 bars was just a glimpse of the truth\nPhysical proof that I'm the best at this\nI've constructed sentences\nThat'll stand longer than Stonehenge's megaliths\nMy 1st and 2nd albums consist of more then a million terabits\nMore than any of you rappers ever spit\nVote for me as President, in about a day or so\nI be up in the White House getting fellatio\nBy an administrative assistant with deep throat\nButt naked on the floor knee deep in some coke\nOr on a speaker phone freestyling with some of my folks\nHumping a ho tampering with the Republican vote\nI'm like Mel Gibson in Braveheart, fighting swordsman\nDodging arrows from the arches cause I'm a Horseman\nFlying circles around you like flying saucers\nFlying circles around the royal air force's flying fortress\nMaximize my wins, minimize my losses\n'Til I'm exhausted then lounge like the lyricists on Rawkus\nI'm unsigned right now, it's like I'm an orphan\nLooking for a home taking all calls and offers\nNotify the Prince and the Duke of Earl\nI'm probably the illest English speaking MC in the world\nGhetto fabulous, verbally hazardous\nAsk any Baptist, Roman Catholic or satanic activist\nEven them trippy hippies on college campuses know about Canibus\nI've got rhymes like beads on an abacus\nMy styles totally out the bracket\nScientist in thick glasses and pocket protectors want to patent it\nMy talent is unmatched by any rapper in this rapping biz\nBy any rapper on this planet's grid\nShow me where he is, I sign the ordinance\nTo bomb his coordinates with Agent Orange and torture him\nBurn the skin off of him, throw a towel on him and stomp on him\nRip the towel off then pour salt on him\nContinue my verbal assault on him til its 12 in the morning\nAnd turn into the werewolf monster on him\nRip his heart out, eat it while its still pumping\nThe blood still running, it tastes like boiled dumplings\nStarving artist, I turned down scholarships to Oxford College\nCause I heard they didn't serve porridge\nSmarter than any man in Scotland Yard is\nUsed to work for MI-6 but quit cause I couldn't take orders\nI was the original James Bond before Sean Conn', Roger Moore\nTimothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan\nThe most awesome walking, talking, breathing\nEnglish speaking MC in the European region\nRip you to pieces like Communism leaflets\nBeef with 'Bis is like playing chess without the pieces\nModern Christians without Jesus, Rastas without reefer\nJamaicans in Princeton without visas\nRadios without speakers, Mother Nature without the four seasons\nWithout a jacket outside when its freezing\nI'mma tell you straight up, no lie\nCanibus is the illest motherfucker alive\nHa ha ha ha ha\nThe evil spirit of rap, the evil rapper\nRip the JackerYou might also like1Embed"

Him over there?\nThe nigga with the South Pole sweatsuit and permed hair?\nListen, don't even trip\nI just want some beats to finish my shit\nI'm looking for some hard shit\nYea, like some Beat Brokers or Mark Sparks shit\nHuh? Play what?\nHold up, lay what?\nYo relax my main man, I'ma call you, peace\"\nI got back to the crib, popped in the CD\nAnd turned it up loud to see if he had some real beats\nI heard something I felt, I hit the nigga on the cell\nTo see if it was for sell\n\"Yo, can I speak to DJ\nYo, I'm feeling tracks two and six\nWhatever, bottom line, you give me the tracks, I give you the cheddar\nWe can do it around ten PM\nIn the studio off of Lankershim\nAt that point, I didn't even feel like answering him\nStupid ass motherfucking producer got me real upset\nAnd I even got to work with him yet\nI showed up at ten thirty so I was already late\nHe showed up after me and forgot to bring his own D.A.T. tapes\nHe shook my hand, with both of his hands\nAnd told me he could play it over again, with both of his friends\nYo, as long as I get tracks two and six\nI don't give a fuck who really produced this shit\nJust do this shit\nWhen I get back, I want it laid\nYea, you gonna get paid\nI'ma leave, jump in the car, speed, go to my mans\nGet some trees, get something to eat, and I'll be back by three\"\nThese stupid producers\n\n\"Hold up, five hours later, you ain't laid nothing?\nNot one piece of percussion? You mean to tell me you ain't press one button?\nYou think this is motherfucking pre-production or something?\nYou know we ain't got a budget, who told you to order lunch, bitch?\nYou know what? Fuck it. I don't even want it no more\nCause the track you selling me probably ain't even yours\"\n\nThese stupid producers\n\nYo, yo\nAyo Rip, motherfuckerYou might also likeEmbed"

The more you fit in, the less you're noticed\nThat's how it is, for anyone to walk through life unnoticed as if they never mattered\nCould be a punishment worse than death, and at the same time\nThat punishment is the only way you could truly be free;\nFree from the things you want people to remember about you\nBut also free from the things you want them to forget\nI don't know if that freedom exists for me anymore\nAnd even though I dream about what it would be like\nIt's just a dream, because I realize now more than ever\nThat I can't have my cake and eat it too, no one can\nAnd as time goes on, we will always be loved by some and hated by others\nAnd whether the people who talk bad about you know it or not\nThey really save you from obscurity every time they mention your name\nYou see, anytime anybody ever talks about you, either directly or indirectly\nThey put a quarter in your immortal meter\nThey keep you alive, whether they want to or not\nThey practically do the opposite of what they want to do\nWhich is forget you. I dedicate this song, to the day\nWhen you motherfuckers finally figure it out\nAnd the day that you bury me, and erase the memory of me\nHere lies a man, who became forgotten to the world\nIn his search to the key for immortality\nHe never made an impact, he changed nothing\nAnd his words meant nothing\nHe never contributed to the rap game;\nHe never gave you anything to talk about\nHe never existed, and he never made a difference\nHis name was nobody!You might also likeEmbed"
