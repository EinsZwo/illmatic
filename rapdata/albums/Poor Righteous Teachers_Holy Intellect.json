Who?] Mrs Coathanger\nIn the compartment of their apartment\nDown with the upside down closet department\nSo you figure it\nBut please don't be a bigot\nMake like a wino, and swig it\nDown your mouth your throat, your esophagus\nI'm too smooth - so get offa this\nSucka. You can't withstand the momentum\nTake em one a day, and a Centrum vitamin. Mr Weasel\nMy mike's like a painting, mike stand's an easel\nYou go Rambo, I go Predator\nCompetitor, editor, creditor, and much better than a\nQuacker. Rapper. Who thinks he's like Dapper\nDan like a seal I keep em clapping his hands\nBalancing, a ball on his nose\nAnd goin' \"Ert ert ert!\" and striking a pose\nFor the camera. But you say \"How?\"\nI say are you an Indian? \"Who?\" - now you're an owl\nHooting. Like a bird always tooting\nPolluting, the atmosphere continually tooting and hooting and looting\nMeanwhile I go freestyle\nHear the funky rap with PRT on Profile\nI'm running out of breath, it's time for Tone to pass it\nHuh-hua! Yo Wise, please gas it\nYou might also like[Verse 2 - Wise Intelligent]\nOnce again, yes my friend, I tends to build up my empire\nPoor Righteous Teachers, teachers\nDem said Poor Righteous Triers\nYeah now that we succeeding they must seat that weak suggestion\nCause now they even students to the Teachers and the lesson\nNo guessing, oh how I love to bomb a weak hypothesis\nListen cause I'm dropping this\nP-R-T posse rocking this\nSmooth with the roughness, this sexy style, yet\nHow can I sink into the crescent of the soul? check\nStummer's comin' [nope no sex?], step the rhythm\nThere goes P-R-T posse gone, cannot keep up with 'em\nThey rocked and they rolled, rolled meaning stepped\nBack upon divine land that's the projects that they rep\nSometimes the teachers teachers show then tell the tribe a-yo let's go\nPack up the equipment get me back into the ghetto\n\n[Wise] Yo um, Culture Freedom, I think it's about that time you showed and proved to yourself - do that!\n[Culture Freedom] I'm gonna do a little somethin like this --\n\n[Verse 3 - Culture Freedom]\nHere's an inorganic, bomb but don't panic\nI'm the soul controller, revolving nine planets\nYes, I'm manifesting, a blessing from the heavens\nPeace, to all the queens, submitting to the seven\nI'm the asiatic, based on mathematic\nYou're the jive junkie, sack crack fanatic\nWrite a knowledge knowledge, wisdom be purified\nMy wisdom will receive, reflect and amplify\n[Banish?] understanding that makes it understood, yo\nI'm Culture Freedom - now ain't that good?\nI use the power of refinement to serve the justice\nI dare you snakes, to ever try to touch this\nI deal equal, that's equality\nFreezing your domes, giving no apology\nSeven and a half, you know that's God\nTell em, truth is food, word is bond\nI build and destroy as the earth keeps proving\nSurrounded by filth but protected with clothing\nShelter's where I store my knowledge to born\nLove is in the cipher, so I go on\nPeace! It's for the cause that I'm rappin' this\nLove brings peace, and peace brings happiness\nTotal satisfaction, from one's own actions\nIf not? Then there's a fatal reaction\nYou call it static in the attic the static will be dynamic\nYou say you're satisfied? Well I'm flattered\nAt the end of this verse, you know who rules\nI have my mathematics divine with twelve jewels\nAnd they're dropped on the brothers and the others that lack\nYo um, here comes the beat, but I'll be back\n[Wise] Word!\n\n[Outro]\n[Culture] Crash-mashin the set, you know what I'm sayin?

Shakiyla for sure\nJust listen as I manifest the love that we share\nYou're with your ring that I wear, and it's my child that you'll bear\nI meditate, not hesitate as I show for my love\nLike word is bond, you're the queen that Wise be's thinking of\nBut no one's ever told me love could be so much fun\nI guess when I got Shakiyla, word 'em up \u2014 I got the one\n\n[Chorus: Culture Freedom]\nI need you girl, I love you girl\nAnd I will never let you go, no no\nSo when you love me back\nJust make sure that you love me nice and slow\nLet me hold you girl, touch you girl\nCaress you gently\n'Cause when we are alone it seems as if I dreamed\nBecause the feeling's ecstasy\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Wise Intelligent]\nI am a King and it's known 'cause to my Queen I have shown\nEverything within myself from the flesh to the bone\nWhen I look in her eyes I get that feeling again\nThey call it physical lust but I'm controlling my sin\n'Cause I'm the King of all things, plus a love song writer\nTo the Queen that I swing, I'm a lover not a fighter\nBut just like all Kings I always say the right things\nTo the Queen that I swing 'cause she's the Queen of all Queens\nI'm in love with my Queen, in my room you'll guess what\nShe starts to kissing my neck, it's time to give me that butt-ter rub\nTreatment because she know loving Wise is much fun\nI guess when I got Shakiyla \u2014 I got the one\n\n[Chorus: Culture Freedom]\nI need you girl, I love you girl\nAnd I will never let you go, no no\nSo when you love me back\nJust make sure that you love me nice and slow\nLet me hold you girl, touch you girl\nCaress you gently\n\n[Verse 4: Wise Intelligent]\nShe puts an L with an O, an V with an E\nShe seals it with a kiss, this isn't to me\nMy response to her love is the way that I feel\nI want her every square inch with a sex appeal\nShakiyla's not attracted to material things\nShe's the perfect presentation of a Wise Black Queen\nWith the chains on her neck she's what a woman should be\nSilly suckers a sweat, but she's devoted to me\nBut no one's ever told me love could be so much fun\nI guess when I got Shakiyla, CF \u2014 I got the one\n[Chorus: Culture Freedom]\nI need you girl, I love you girl\nAnd I will never let you go, no no\nSo when you love me back\nJust make sure that you love me nice and slow\nLet me hold you girl, touch you girl\nCaress you gently\n'Cause when we are alone it seems as if I dreamed\nBecause the feeling's ecstasy\nShakiyla my QueenEmbed"

Why equals knowledge born\nAll those with it say \"word is bond\" (word is bond!)\nI give my life if my word should fail\nIt's all a part of the life that I live\nNope, I'm not a snake so I don't conceal\nI born the truth in the rhymes that I give\nBut I thought, as I drop my style I let the lessons be taught\n\nI be droppin, quote say I'm toppin the topic Islamic\nBut let ask the students I teach - I'm sole controlling\nAll the mics I be holding\nWatch mental heights that I reach I profile\nFunky new radical style\nI be stylin this style, flauntin my new styles of speech\nGotta teach, and those that be lost I will find them of course -\nThen give them the power to speak\nLike a captain, [stabbin?] [???] the head of lieutenants\nFunky new music I'm in it, spin it -\nLife let the lessons begin\nOne to ten, we're all original men, come again\nPoor Righteous Teachers are not making friends -\nDon't believe it ask Tim - Baylor - cause Tim Baylor's a failure I tell you\nHe was slippin and slipped his whole label\nThey're unable to come up with hits (cause they ain't kickin shit)\nI'm the teacher\nGive me a set to protest what I test, In Divine Land Projects\nSneaky snakes, Divine City records these snakes that I speak of\nTamper with Poor Righteous Teachers but please!\nDon't they know Poor Righteous Teachers are large?\nBuilt from this family of Gods?\n[We perform or make on the weight?] of a positive thought\nAs I drop my styles, I let the lessons be taught\nYou might also likeI'm the teacher, students acknowledge the weight of my thought\nOr be caught in the web of those devils\nGod's no illusion, I'm the teacher, I teach\nWise be not racist or rebel\nI swing, while wearing the crown of the king\nVibe for vibe, [thing for thing?] I'm pulling you have seen\nPoor Righteous Teachers were wisely teaching\nThat of the unseen\nWait\nWith your thought can I obtain\nFeel the vibe from the crescent of Wise's brain\nDroppin' pain if you claim to entertain\nPower spoken, savage tamed, smooth and plain\nWell yes the intellect\nLessons dropped with no sweat\nI step off, you say 'damn that shit was caught'\nStyle dropped, lessons taught\nWord is bond, as I drop my style I let the lessons be taughtEmbed"

Tell the real story (x4)\n\n[Verse 2]\nSo I proceed\nTo teach you from three hundred and sixty degrees of what you're lackin -\nThe fabrics, core knowledge of yourself\nMany felt, the coming of the lord and the lord came himself\nCouldn't send nobody else\nBlack people, stop and take a look at where you're at -\nProjects, modern-day cage for the blacks\nWake up - from these animalistic problems\nGive them back their Bible, cause it's unable to solve them\nWe must come together as a people\nTeach each as an equal\nAbout the right way to go\nYo, take off your cross black, because it's crossin up your mental\nYou fail to comprehend the flow and I'm kickin it to ya -\nKickin it to ya straight from Divine Land\nSpeaking upon a god, so I must be speaking upon a Blackman\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nThis is ghetto, 100% rough like a hallway\nUp in D-Land Projects where the PRT p-osse stay\nWhy must we try to be materially financed?\nI'm not sellin drugs, I'm for the people of Divine Land\nLow income projects, that is\nPoor Righteous Teacher keeps the head above negative\nWell, very true - but what must one do to get it through to you?\nSpeak when spoken to, or grab the mic and simply bomb a few, weak\nNot right, lowlifes not the ghetto type\nBut usin' eyes for the hype\nNot kickin it to ya -\nNot kickin it to ya straight from Divine Land\nNot speaking upon a god, not even speaking upon a blackman\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[Verse 4]\nI use this fabric, this fabric called knowledge of myself\nThat keeps me striving - risin' to the tip-top\nI often mention, or rock ya like a shocker to get attention\nGods, are ruling up in hip hop\nWhy stop? When I drop what I top with insight\nLight for the spot, not rows to the left\nRight? Right meaning black to be exact you put the needle to the wax\nCome hear my actual facts\nMaker the owner, creamer of the planet, my life do you have it\nMany of us cram to understand and I'm kickin it to ya -\nKickin it to ya straight from Divine Land\nSpeaking upon a god so I must be speaking upon a Blackman\n\n[Outro]\nLike I said, strictly for the one them call Culture Freedom, cause we can do dat.

Now!\n\n[Verse 2: Wise Intelligent (Culture Freedom)]\nI self lord and my every day aggravation\nMeditating, awaiting on the way to get away\nNot run son, the son of man can't stand this land\nWhere blacks stay symbolic to the prey\nOh me (oh my) why I can't deny\nThat Wise and the teachers were lost\nBut that was then and this is now\n(How?) can one say false is what the Gods were taught\nYou silly pigeon, Wise be ain't dealing with no religion\nBrothers listen, only them comprehend\nPure fact from a brother that loves being black\nFact - negativity can't win, limit sin\nTell the others their time is done (yo)\nNo need for cooking that ass in the sun (and uh)\nAnd Wise's life has just begun\nAnd my desire's to have some fun\n\n[Interlude: Malcolm X speech]\nI know you, brother. Me and you are brothers\nWe flesh of each other's flesh, bone of each other's bone\nI know why you faking, because you got a greater (*scratch*)\nGreater desire to be known. And you have a desire to have money\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Wise Intelligent]\nI self lord and the PRT posse feel it\nDeath - for all you brothers out there selling weak shit\nDip - is my hip hop so I drop the profane\n'Cause that's the only way they'll understand it\nIf - I was to say 'yo black stop selling crack'\nNo I don't think a single soul would listen\nBut - if I was to riff bum rush and start dissing\nI'd give you total comprehension\n'Cause all them wants to see is violence and negativity\nBut the problem is lack of unity\nBlack is black regardless to what state your from\nYou're wrong, and you're blind deaf and dumb\nWhy can't we say 'to hell with the red, white and blue'?\nThe green black and red's coming through\nTeaching what was taught by those that teach we teachers\nAnd civilizes all the black kids\n\n[Interlude: (sample) Louis Farrakhan speech]\n(The problem is this:) you have no unity  (*scratch*)\nYou don't see that your unity is the key to your success  (*scratch*)\nBecause you so divided, so disunited, so full of petty envy and jealousy you don't see that unity is the key to your success\n\n[Verse 4: Wise Intelligent]\nI self lord and my musical way of building\nWilling - to speak the power to the people\nEqual - only to ones self because ones self be but a brother\nOthers is the fact that I be legal\n'See ya' - what I may say when I be stepping\nOff into the projects called Divineland\nWise stand around and watch the king that wears the crown?\nYou can be down with the get down sound\nAs if the gift was simply trying to lift\nThe moral standards of the people\nMy people, to whom there's not another people\nEqual - to the lost and found\nHmm - a brief sign of meditation\nFaking - moves a brother can't cope\nDope - one deaf one dumb one blind\nNow is it funky now, nope\n[Interlude: Malcolm X speech]\nAsk my brother: what is he saying? He's telling black kids to get a good education... He's telling black kids to learn the knowledge of themselves so they can love themselves\n\n[Outro: Culture Freedom]\nPeace!Embed"
