Sometimes you make me feel real low\nBickerin' about the groupies and the hoes I know\nSmilin' in my face at each and every show I throw\nDo you propose I go? I don't know\n(But stay!) Cause when I think that this won't last\nI reminisce on how you helped me through shit in the past\nAnd all of a sudden things don't seem so bad\nAnd I'm back gettin' the ass (they ain't stupid)\nYou should go, we beef, you say it's all my fault\nLike I'm the one responsible for every time we fought\nBut when I'm packing up my shit you say we need to talk\nNow should I stay or walk?\n(I can't help you on this one, man)\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse Two]\n(Stay!) The other night we went to dinner to chill\nSo we could talk about our problems and the way we feel\nPerfect therapy over a Red Lobster meal\nNow this is love for real (I like this, do your thing)\n(Then go!) But then you start trippin' on some waitress shit\nLike she was too friendly, you couldn't take this shit\nPlayin' me like a nigga used to date the chick\nShe tryin' to make a tip (cut that bullshit out, man)\n(But stay!) After a drink or two, we chilled out\nAnd talked while the waitress brought the meals out\nWe ate like grown-ups and talked it out\nI even held the door open when I walked you out (uh huh)\n(But go!) Before I knew it, she pissed again\nMad cause I got up and slipped a ten\nShe wasn't actin' rude, why you trippin' then?\nNow you actin' like a bitch again (fuck that shit!)\nYou might also like[Hook]Embed"

It's not a prob\nWhat's two or three cars for I'm not the mob (Uh-uh)\nI'm just a young rap artist\nDo the shit you probably refer to as ''that garbage''\nWhich probably makes me a black target\nThat's why I don't love you, whole or half-hearted\nA lot of police should feel like a thug\nWhen I see the boys in blue, I feel like a blood\nBut I ain't gang related (No)\nSketch you in court when you change your statement\n[Hook] (Guilty Simpson)\nMiddle finger to the blue and whites\nThat wanna get behind the car and flash the light\nLike FREEZE!\nPut your hands on the wall\nThey want us behind bars for life\nAnd won't grant your rights to call your wife\nLike FREEZE!
