    "lyrics": "So Long Lyrics[Intro - Cadillac on 22's plays in background]\nI think for the most part, our generation is filled with a bunch of fuckin' cowards\nAnd I say that man, because we beef amongst eachother...\nWe kill and we shootin eachother in our own hoods, and bang eachother\nWe won't bang cops, ya know I'm sayin?\nAnd one thing that these motherfuckers in America know...\nThey know we-they know we ain't gon' do shit (Do shit- Do shit)\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm grippin the nina, visions of 9/11\nVisions of three sixes, no sevens\nThis is Bush-enomics\nGeorge is a modern day Ronald Reagan\nI pray to God, in the midst of Pagans\nNiggas, I'm just sayin\nWhen do we stop playin?\nWhen do we stop pimpin and start sprayin?\nFifty shots for every cop that popped Sean Bell, his body layin\nBut they acquit\nBecause they know that our generation won't do shit!\nNothin; nada\nBut every rapper is a shotta or a don dadda, or a killa\nBut you ain't killin nothin in this piece, unless it's another nigga\nTryin'a raise boys to supermen\nAnd while I'm at it, FUCK Arthur J. Cooperman\nIt's never justice for blacks, but they send just us to Iraq...\nWith poor whites and Latinos\nI pray to God that you hear this single...\nThis is Banner's MIDDLE FINGER, y'all ignant!\n[Hook]\nI've been waitin in the hood for so long\nI've been waitin in the hood for so long\nFor some niggas to stand up in here\nWe some soldiers, and we have no fear\nI've been waitin in the hood for so long\nI've been waitin in the hood for so long\nFor some niggas to stand up in here\nWe some soldiers, and we have no fear\n\n[Verse 2]\nMs. Kathryn Johnston was murdered by police...\nIn Northwest Atlanta, but I don't hear it in the streets\nWhere the anger in the hood for this old lady dyin?\nD.C. six, ain't shit but cops lyin\nAin't shit but bullets flyin\nThirty-nine slugs from undercovers, FUCK the law!\nThis was somebody damn grandmother...\nAnd she died over crack sales\nCrooked ass cops, or some niggas tryin'a flip yayo\nYou ain't have to sell it in her yard\nYou ain't trappin, bitch you yappin to the motherfuckin guards\nAnd I got a damn question...\nWhy the city ain't pissed off?\nWhen I know y'all heard shots, and old lady got hauled off, y'all igna'nt!\nYou might also like[Hook]\nI've been waitin in the hood for so long\nI've been waitin in the hood for so long\nFor some niggas to stand up in here\nWe some soldiers, and we have no fear\nI've been waitin in the hood for so long\nI've been waitin in the hood for so long\nFor some niggas to stand up in here\nWe some soldiers, and we have no fear\n\n[Outro]\nI wanna see a nigga riot or somethin dogg, fight for somethin!\nFight anybody but yo' motherfuckin self, nigga\nWe sell drugs, but we gon' sell drugs to our self\nWe bang, but we only bang on our self\nWe do every fuckin negative thing and niggas is so hard...\nNiggas on radio, on cd's, on tapes, and on movies, they got guns, they got pistols\nBut ain't nobody shootin' it at nothin but they self\nFear is the only thing that people respect\nWe forget everybody but ourselves\nThese cops gon' have to fear somethin', somethin' have to happen\nNigga if y'all gon' march, march to the motherfuckin cops house, my nigga\nMake these motherfuckas fear somethin, dude\nCause they make- they got us scared!\nThey got niggas scared to go to strip clubs, nigga, you know\nShit, my nigga, like... somethin gotta happen\nI'll say it my nigga, cause I ain't scared {*Cadillac on 22's resumes*}\nI ain't scared of shit, I'm scared of God...\nI'm scared of God first\nAnd I'm scared of taking the blessing that God has given me-\nAnd leading somebody down the wrong path {*echoes*}Embed"

They look at us as cotton pickers\nThey might as well cause we love to call ourselves n*ggas\nAnd George Bush is a part of a bigger problem\nOld America loves hate, man they'll never stop it\nAnd every rapper that I see has a ki but not the key to be free\nIf God is only one, how could she be 3?\nMaybe the key to hell lies in the trinity\nThere's no divinity in politics\nI get more chips if I call my mother a bitch\nI made a record like this\nThe greatest story ever told\nWhat if I said I didn't want to tell stories no more?\nWhat if I wanted to tell the truth?\nWe fucked up!You might also likeEmbed"
