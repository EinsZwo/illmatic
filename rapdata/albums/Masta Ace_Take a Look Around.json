Special delivery\nThere's no time, here's a rhyme, go ahead open it\nThis is a letter to the better, I know you're hoping it\nMight be some claim on my greatness\nBut once I state this, watch the crabs rate this\nYou wear a crown, you don't deserve one\nYou need a meal for the mind and I'll serve one\nLike a chef so def, I'm gonna rip up\nRhymes they gonna rip up those that turn a lip up\nOne page at a time, you keep reading\nEach stage of the rhyme, where's it leading?\nYou want to know where a path leads, you follow it\nI feed you your pride and make you swallow it\nUsed to be an innocent bystander and the\nLotta years filled my ears with slander\nWhy should I choose to get used to the way you burn?\nWhen will you learn that every rapper has a turn?\nAnd when the spotlight shines on you, you ought to glow\nAnd show, the next man how to grow\nAnd so, enough said about yourself\nThe central wealth of our people is mental health\nAnd good things come in due time\nAnd through rhyme, watch as a few climb\nNon stop, straight to the top just to get a\nGreat big piece of the pie, this is a letter to the betterYou might also likeEmbed"

(Uh-huh)\nOne two\nMicrophone check'a one two\nMicrophone check'a one two\nMicrophone check'a one two\nTell 'em what I'm gonna do:\n[Master Ace]\nOn and on and on is how the beat goes\nSo sell the British Walkers and cut the afros\nAnd dance 'til the feeling is gone in your toes\nI wear shorts in the summer, Timberlands when it snows\nSometimes I like to chill, sometimes I like to mingle\nSometimes I get the fever for the flavor of a single\nSexy young slimmy, but not too young, though\nThat's because Jimmy might end up on death row\nNow this here jam is like a special kind of song\nIt's not too short, but then again it\u2019s not too long\nI brought somebody with me, someone you might know\nHe's bound to wreck your body from the tip of your toe\nAll the way up to your last hair follicle\n\n[Master Ace as Biz Markie]\nHey hey hey, it\u2019s me the diabolical\nYes, y\u2019all and, it\u2019s time for me to fall in\nTo a funky beat to make you have a ball and like\nJump, make you move your rump on the floor and like pump\nC\u2019mon don\u2019t be a chump, I see four and maybe five\nLive party people but the rest did not survive\n(Why?)\nThey had a cardiac arrest\nNow, rocking microphones is something I do daily and\nMaking people dance like if I was Alvin Ailey, and\nPeople just love it when the Biz starts to play\nWith my [beatboxing] and by the way\nSkeezing with a girl is something I get tricky\nAnd I\u2019m the sneaky type to like slip a girl a mickey\nAnd I live the type of life that\u2019s far from affordable\nStanding on the corner calling cuties on the portable\nMe and master ace is funky (word to miz)\nYo, who is it Ace? (it\u2019s me and the Biz)\nYou might also like[Hook]\nIt\u2019s me and the Biz (repeat 4x)\n\n[Master Ace as Biz Markie]\nYo Ace, I got an, um, question\nExcuse me brother, but can you spare a dime?\n\n[Master Ace]\nNaw, but if you want, I can kick a funky rhyme\nAll I need is a groove that\u2019s as smooth like a harp and\nI\u2019m ready to talk \u2018nough shit like Al Sharpton\nI take the stage and engage in a page and\nMy name is Master Ace and 22 is the age\n\n[Master Ace as Biz Markie]\nYo, I'm the B-I-Z-M and, like a lot of women\nBought a new car because the first one was a lemon\nGucci, Louis, Fendi. Me and sexy Cindy\nRiding around the block as if I was in the Indy.\nEverybody pointing cause I am the joint and\nThey know it's me, because I'm the B-I-Z\nSometimes I lie in bed all day and think about my life\nShould I just kick rap and settle down with kids and a wife?\nAnd get a regular job where I'm working 9 to 5\nShit, I'm the Biz and it's great to be alive\n[Master Ace]\nI'm making crazy hits, a winner never quits\nSo those that used to diss me in the past are having fits\nBut I just sit back and kick my feet up on the table\n'Cause I'm able to rock a crowd without a cable\nOr a Cuban link and (yo, Lincoln wasn't Cuban!)\nSo I still produce Def Jams like my name was Ricky Rubin\nM-A-S-T-E-R and this ain't store bought hip-hop from a jar and\nIt sure ain't Stephanie Mills playing Dorothy in the wiz [beatboxing]\nIt's me and the Biz\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Master Ace]\nI'm a 100% proof and rag on the roof and\nPulling crazy cuties without a gold tooth and\nWilding, styling, this land is my land\n(you're a) prisoner to my music like you was on Rikers Island\nA slim, soft-spoken brother from the ghetto\nMy name is Master Ace and I thought that you should know\nYou run your rhymes like a horse and force and\nExtra booty lyrics on the crowd like you\u2019re the boss and\nI think you\u2019d better keep them to yourself\nDo it for yourself, put your lyrics back up on the shelf\nNow I\u2019m going to pass it to the B-I-Z M-A-R-K-I-E\n'Cause I know you want to see him\n\n[Master Ace as Biz Markie]\nAh one two, one two, this is what I\u2019m gonna do\nKeep the place jumping, get it wild like a zoo\nIf anyone can do it, the B-I-Z can\nPeace to Marley Marl, Tragedy, and MC Shan\nAnd my cousin Cool V and, TJ Swan E and\nThe Jungle Brothers swinging from a tree and\nEPMD and, Nice and Smooth B and\nMC Craig G and, Just I-C-E and\nThe list goes on and on and on and on\nI go to Dapper Dan or Benetton\n\nHey hey, I got some shoutouts, I know you all bought my new album\nI know everybody in Brooklyn bought it\nEverybody in Jersey bought it\nEverybody in Uptown bought it\nEverybody in Philadelphia and California and Florida bought my new album\nI\u2019m Biz Markie, I\u2019m down with my cousin Cool V, TJ Swan, Marley Marl...2Embed"

And, um, I'm not on crack, I don't do drugs, I'm just trying to get something to eat. If you can give just a penny, a nickel..a dime, a quarter..anything will be greatly appreciated. Thank you for your time...and have a nice day\n\n[Verse 1]\nHow do you do?\nI'm from the other side of town\nThe place where the only skin you see is the color brown\nThe sun never shines in this place where I live\nAnd it's hard to do right when you feel negative\nI have no compassion\nI only know aggression\nAnd there is nothing great about this oppression\nPeople I see on TV, in there towns live the good life\nBut I live out of bounds\nWhere nobody comes unless they're forced to come\nIn school, they call me the bum from the slum\nBut they don't know\nMy sista has no food to eat\nAnd her hand-me-down shoes are too tight for her feet\nThe way I see things, life isn't fair\nSo I never learned how to share or to care\nBut to hope - and hope\nInstead of feeling down\nAnd that's how it is\nOn the other side of town\nI live on the other side of town\n\n[Verse 2]\nPardon me, brotha\nAs you stand in your glory\nI hope you don't mind as I tell the whole story\nSome people livin' life like fun in the sun\nBut yo, others are givin' strife, and that's all they know\nI feel no comfort in talks from the President\nSo put back on Cosby\nA shack is my residence\nI think if I ever die, it might be a blessin'\nSome say I never try, but why are they stressin'\nI'll never get ahead; my raps have a better chance\nI'm livin' on Wonder Bread with holes in my leather pants\nI'm not on the drug scene; they call me a crack head\nI just had a bugged dream that I was a black man\nWorkin' in the hospital\nThen in came in a half-dead rich bitch\nYo, they must be insane\nYou think I would save her?\nYo, she wouldn't save me\nI asked for a quarter once, and guess what she gave me\nA fuckin' penny\nHer coat costs half a mill\nIf it's up to me, yo, she's pushin' up daffodils\nIn a casket\nPayback's a female dog\nYo, send her ass to the morgue\nThen I woke up, and I sat with a frown\nDamn, I woke up\nBut on the other side of town\nYou might also likeThe other side of town\n\n[Verse 3]\nMy teacher's a fat man\nYo, how can they tempt me so\nFuck geometry, my stomach is empty, yo\nCan't you teach me to win this crazy game?\nYou and I are in so many ways the same\nPeople tell me, but I don't believe that shit\nWhy do you sell me a dream, then leave me spit?\nThe truth is bare, and so is my cupboards, too\nI wonder what could even L. Ron Hubbard do\nBecause my mind right now is on the brink of breakin'\nYo, look how I think\nI think I'll stick up the store with the Arab guy\nI'm sick of him anyway; his prices are too high\nOr maybe I'll start sellin' Avon door-to-door\nThen pull a jammy, and make a bigger score\nNah, maybe I'll start sellin' dope for my cuz\nThen I could drive the same car he does\nThe life of a poor man\nConsider me desperate\nI sleep in a cold room\nAnd wish I could just get\nA piece of the pie\nIs that asking too much?\nI can't even reach what others have in their clutch\nI wish I could go on, but I have to end this\nAnd get back to livin' a life that is winless\nThere's no use swimmin', so I might as well drown\nIn my sorrows\n'Cause tomorrow's the other side of town\n[Outro]\nThe other side of town\nThe other side of townEmbed"

    "lyrics": "Ace Iz Wild Lyrics[Intro]\nLet's get wild\nYeah, Master Ace in the house\nThe whole Action Posse's in the house\nIce-U-Rock's in the house, DJ Marley Marl's in the house\nSteady Pace is in the house, and we gonna do it like this\n\n[Verse 1]\nSo many New Jacks and Jills on the hill\nBut only one bucket, so fuck it, they get the dills\nCause you no frills, that means your name ain't household\nNow watch that little mouse fold\nYou can't take the pressure from the cooker\nStood there looking soft, so I started hooking off\nAnd took her, I know she used to be yours\nNow she's riding on the bus with us and doing tours\nAlong with some other little runts\nWe call her a fall girl, she does so many stunts\nAnd then she got liver, she did it with the guy that drives the bus\nNow she's a screw driver\nMaster Ace is flipping\nYour grip is slipping, it's time I start stripping\nYoung ladies and the titles that hold 'em\nI treat 'em like a pretzel: bend, stretch, and fold 'em\nAnd I can do the same damage on stage\nBlack, white, or beige, you're gonna feel the rage\nThe same way the sluts with the big butts felt it\nI'm not a dealer but I dealt it\nSo if you plan on riffing when I spank ya\nBe prepared to grab your ankles because\n[Chorus]\n(Ace is wild!) No, not really\n(Ace is wild!) Come on, you're acting silly\n(Ace is wild!) You know I'm just chilling\n(Ace is wild!) Come on, stop illing\n\n[Verse 2]\nFor whom the bell tolls, it tolls for all of those\nWho lost out, cause I was at the polls\nAnd I saw the results as they came in\nSo many wild-ass ones that need taming\nBut I hold a whip and a chair\nAnd I don't play fair, so you'd better stay there\nUntil I say \"Jump through the fire\"\nBut I won't get burned, I learned to admire\nFrom way across the room first\nAnd after I study, buddy, that's when I kick a verse\nThat's high powered, you got devoured\nBy the jaws of death, you little coward\nScared to step in this arena\nWhere the grass is greener, you're looking meaner and meaner\nBut your look ain't scaring me away\nSo I just stay and say words to make your head sway\nCapital A-C-E, boy\nServing the masses, you'd better take some classes\nIf you want to hang with this here\nAnd if you get near, I'll eat you like a pear (Crunch)\nBut I don't really eat a lot of fruit\nSo say \"ahh\" (Mmmmmmph!) Now don't you look cute?\nYou might also like[Chorus]\n(Ace is wild!) Nah, no I'm not\n(Ace is wild!) I just like to bug a lot\n(Ace is wild!) Leave me alone\n(Ace is wild!) Turn up the microphone\n(Ace is wild!) Yeah...\n\n[Verse 3]\nMr. Gangster, who you trying to kid?\nFake, flam, and fess and dress the way you did\nThis is a microphone war\nYou say you're well-known, but what are you known for?\nA porno flick and a hard dick\nAnd always bragging about the girls you stick\nTitle for king? Yo I don't compete for that\nPaid your dues? Let me see a reciept for that\nSomebody put you on yesterday\nAnd you fess today, and that's just the way\nA sucker is supposed to operate\nJust turn on my mic and I'm straight\nNow you fronting like you got a million G's\nJust because you sold a couple of LP's\nNow you walking around thinking you're the man\nCause you bought a little suit from Dapper Dan\nBut so what? You still ain't dapper\nHolding the mic makes you look like a rapper\nBut you're just a sloppy copy cat\nFront on me and I'm a hit you with a bat\nBottom of the ninth, two out, and I'm at the plate\nAnd smack! Over the left field gate\nThat's where your head goes, you're Rudolph the Red Nosed\nAnd you can't join in, you shouldn't have said those\nRhymes that sound so merrily merrily\nSince you're soft like pound cake from Sarah Lee\nI might cut a slice, then say \"What a nice\nSucker to gobble up with beans and rice\"\nYou fat little rat from the sewer\nI eat you like a meal, pass you like manure\nPut you in the garden where my flower grows\nThen where's your power? Tell me where your power goes\nSomebody does your dirty work for you\nThrow up your hands like a man so I can floor you\nAnd oh, if you pull a jammy\nYou can run from Brooklyn to Miami\nFrom Miami to Nevada\nYou'd better have a lotta, I mean a whole knot of\nPayola, cause I'm about to roll a\nMic like a cess joint, so brother here's a bowl of\nPride, now eat it up\n'Cause I get kind of wild when I heat it up\n[Chorus]\n(Ace is wild!) Nah, not really\n(Ace is wild!) Come on, you're acting silly\n(Ace is wild!) You know I'm just chilling\n(Ace is wild!) Yo yo yo, stop illing\n(Ace is wild!) No, I'm not\n(Ace is wild!) I feel kinda hot\n(Ace is wild!) But I'm not acting wild\n(Ace is wild!) You know that ain't my style\n(Ace is wild!) You know I'm just cooling\n(Ace is wild!) And also I'm ruling\n(Ace is wild!) I ain't messing with nobody\n(Ace is wild!) I just wanna have a party\n(Ace is wild!) No, no\n(Ace is wild!) Come on, yo\n(Ace is wild!) It's me and Marley Marl\n(Ace is wild!) And I'm the Music Man, y'allEmbed"

Rap, and Marley Marl\nFrom the Music Man, y'all\n[Outro]\n\"Once you hear the Capital A\" \"You should know\"\n\"Action is in eff-eff-ect-ect\" (Repeat 4x)\n\n\"Ace in Action\" \"Steady Pace\" (Repeat 'til fade)You might also likeEmbed"

Got DJ Clash in the\nHouse...and my DJ, Steady Pace on the cut, right? [Doin' the rest]\nRight, so I'm about to get into somethin' here...\n\n[Verse 1]\nI'm Master Ace, from a place\nOr should I say borough\nWhere they like the bass to be thorough\nWith the kick of a mule\nAnd the click of a tool with no bullets\nIn the clip, it's the trick of a fool\nCuz he who fronts gets blunts you can't smoke\nTo pull such stunts is no joke\nYou better know where you are first\nTry to be rude and get chewed like a Starburst\nNow how much juice you got?\nYou couldn't hang if I made a noose and knot\nNow try that on for size\nToo much baseball, too many apple pies\nClick your heels three times, kid\nAnd now you can see what my rhymes did\nSuckers and nerds come in herds just like cattle\nFirst I brand them, then I hand them a rattle\nSo they can make a little noise in protest\nThose that fussed got bust wearin' no vest\nI told that MC to go West\nLet's see who can put on a show best\nThe creep that tried to sleep got no rest\nI got a rap that can trap a slow pest\nWhere's your girl? She's out on a ho quest\nFingernail tips, red lips, summer stroll dressed\nIn a camisole she's a pro blessed\nWith a great big backside but no breasts\nWelcome to the fire pit\nI know some kids that wish you'd worn some flyer shit\nCuz as soon as you stepped off the train\nThey woulda put a big nine to your brain\nBe on the lookout, and yo, keep lookin'\nCuz there's a battle goin' on in Brooklyn\n[Verse 2]\nJust like the water in a river flows, I'm fluid\nAnd as I do it, I deliver blows\nSo MCs, you better keep your left up\nTry to fight and you might just get F'd up\nCuz I'll terminate, as you learn a great lesson\nDon't ever try messin' or you'll earn a fate\nWorse than death cuz I'm here to give it to ya\nYou got a life, but don't know how to live it do ya?\nI live on a day-to-day basis\nDoin' my shows in all kinds of places\nYou sit home with a frowned-up grill\nTalkin' 'bout who ya gonna kill\nWell listen up psychopath\nPut down the Uzi, stop tryin' to play Shaft\nCuz life ain't a TV screen\nBullets can puncture the skin, rupture the spleen\nAnd the stuff that flows out your veins ain't ketchup\nSit back, relax as I sketch up\nThe scene on a Brooklyn street on a late night\nIt was a great fight to me\nI was just an innocent bystander\nLet me try and, uh, explain why I'd hand a\nBrother a big fat stick\nWell it was that, or get his black ass kicked\nSee, it was five against one\nBut this brother was too proud to run\nSo he stood in like a trooper\nFightin' against all odds against a group of\nBrothers that looked the same way he looked, friend\nIt was a battle in BrooklynYou might also likeEmbed"

Well I think you're guessin'\nNo time for fessin' or fakin', messin' or makin'\nMistakes, 'cause it takes heavyweights to stakes\nOr high, so why would you ever want to front?\nAnd try such a stunt, now the Ace is gonna hunt\nYa down, you clown, 'cause the sound that you're hearin' is dope\nYou can't cope slowpoke, so pick up the soap\nAnd catch a bad one, you wanted a chance and you had one\nYou lost it course you sad one\nYou can't get with the style you hit with\nIn this rhyme, so maybe next time\n[Verse 2]\nUptown, downtown, crosstown, no matter where you're from\nGet on the floor and get dumb\n'Cause the Master, capital A-C-E is about to kick it wicked\nHere's the title, in your face I'm gonna stick it\nBut yo don't reach, leash the speech that you use\nNeeds a little more spice, ice, you're nice\nThe style that I heard was third nerd, you gotta be sweet, Pete\nYou can't make money sayin' rhymes on the street\nSo yo get back, Jack, a smack is what you might just get\nTo the grill, Bill, so chill, or I might just swing, King\nCrown, you're down you're like a wingless plane, Wayne\n'Cause you ain't fly, in fact you try and I'm a rain\nRight on your head so shed hats and coats\nThe votes are in friend, I win hands down, clown\nYou tried biting, but biting is a crime\nSo maybe next time\n\n[Verse 3]\nI like to cruise around the city, find me a witty\nSeditty, sexy young lady that is pretty\n(Meow meow meow) Says the kitty\nThe hotel room I got's a buck fifty\nBooties in miniskirts, cuties and plenty Certs\nTo make sure my breath is up to par and\nI introduce myself as the capital A-C-E\nAnd say \"Hello\" and \"Bonjour\" if she's foreign\nAnd if she's a little bit older I'll put her head on my shoulder\nAnd I hold her, 'cause nobody told her\nThat the Master Ace, could move so many hips\nJust by the sounds from my lips\nWell um dinner was a winner, the movie was groovy\nThe park was dark as we walked and talked\nStayed and played, chased and raced\nSat and chat, shared and stared, into each other's eyes and lies\nSpilled from your mouth right then\n'Cause as we kissed you insisted, you had no boyfriend\nBut I know you cousin and your cousin dropped dime\nOh well, maybe next time\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nMC's actin' wild better get calm\nOr you'll get laughed at like like a sitcom\nI spell my name A with the C-E\nNot an \"LF\" folks, and I'm displayin' \"Different Strokes\"\nHuh, I'm \"Head of the Class\" fast and furious\nRhymes as you get \"M*A*S*H-ed\" as I have \"Good Times\"\nAnd \"Happy Days\" I'm slick like a hummer\nAnd smooth and kick my rhymes like a punter\n\"One Day at a Time\" is how I live life\nSo no I'm not \"Married With Children\" and no I do not have a wife\nInstead I would prefer to have a girl and\nExperience \"Growing Pains\" 'cause it's a \"Different World\" and\nRappers try to play me, just like a sport\nTry to bite my rhymes at \"Night\" but get \"Court\"\n\"Give Me A Break\" catch a \"Taxi\" and leave town\nYou might be a \"Star\" but I'll \"Trek\" you down\nRapping, it's a living and it's been one for years\n\"Jeffersons\" in my wallet, champagne in my glass, I say \"Cheers\"\nYou wish you could be slick with the rhymes, don't you?\nBut maybe next timeEmbed"

(yeah right, K)\nO-oh, what's up, you think I'm jokin'?\nJust because I'm broke and I came here by a token?\nYeah aight, sleep and keep snoozin'\nGive me a week, in her Benz you'll see me cruisin'\nI'll be like, \"yeah, what up, yo?\"\n(Yo) \"want a lift to the 3 train?\" (yeah, man...) No\nCall a cab to come and get'cha\n'Cause I'm too damn fly to be seen wit'cha\nI be chillin', livin' like the most guy\nLookin' fly, cause I know how to post high\n\n(High)\nI be postin' high\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nAh, Master Ace, and how are you?\nEnjoy the party? Word, yo, I am too\nSo what's your name? Hmm, that's kinda different\nI must say hard to spell, I trust - hey!\nIs that a diamond in your gold front?\nCute - so is that custom-made Gucci suit\nCost a lot? Damn, that's kinda steep\nOh yo, I think you got a beep\nThe pay phone is right - oh, you got a car phone?\nGo right ahead, I be at the bar alone\nHurry back, okay? Hurry back\n'Cause as I look around, these other girls are very wack\n( *humming to the music* )\nDamn, ay yo, what's takin' her so long?\nI wanted us to dance, they just put on my song\n(Yo Ace, there she is) Ay yo, who's that she's with?\n(That's Merlin, he drives a Sterling, he's kinda swift)\nOh, it's like that? Well, go head, miss fly\nI see how you're livin', you're livin' on the high\nPost\n\n(High)\nYo, she's postin' high\n\n[Verse 4]\nAlright, alright, maybe you are right\nI need to stay down off the post, because the hype\nMight make me light in the head, so instead\nI stay down on the ground where they frown, 'cause they're fed\nBecause they wanna live a life with glamor\nThey hope and hope and hope, but like a hammer\nReality shatters every single hope\nSo what they do, is simply try to cope\nBut who can be happy livin' in the state of poverty\nWatchin' the next man live greater?\nAll he ever does is wish for a chance\nWishin' he could buy the suits and the silk pants\nAnd all she ever does is pray\nThat one day she'll have a full-link mink, but hey\nThey want somethin' for nothin'\nYou gotta work, jerk, it's not that tough, and\nWise up, rise up, and then you can size up to the fly\nAnd wear the clothes of those that post high\n(High)\nPostin high\n\nPost high - but keep a level mind\nPost high - but never live blind\nPost high - but never make that\nThe most important whisker on your cat\nPost high - but never put the next man down\nPost high - but keep your feet on the ground\nPost high - but don't forget your friends\nWhile you're doin' laps in your Benz\nPostin' high\n\nDJ Steady Pace - is postin' high\nMr. Cee - is postin' high\nCraig G - is postin' high\nKing Asiatic - is postin' high\nBiz Mark and Cool V - are postin' high\nRoxanne Shante - is postin' highEmbed"

Am I lying? Shoot\nDon't even front, you even had a Hawaiian suit\nYou might also likeHaha..\nCrazy, I never had a Hawaiian suit, man\nYo Uneek, go 'head\n\n[ VERSE 3: Uneek ]\nThe nineties are here, times are going fast\nAnd it's the perfect time to reminisce about the past\nWhen I think about it, I get a pang\nAnd hear people back then talk with they slang\nI hear it now, it sounds corny\nWhen 'give me a pound' was 'lay some skin on me'?!\nPeople wore afros and called it their natural\nAnd if you were soft back then, it meant that you\nWere a sucker boy who used to irk me\nYou never was really down, a jive-time turkey\nMost other kids used to joke and diss\nIt was called a ( ? ) and it'd sound like this\n(That's why you got rejects) then the next guy would say\n(But my rejects are new and yours are old, okay?)\n\nWord\nNow we sayin Big Uneek\n\n[ VERSE 4: Uneek ]\nAs I reminisce I'll always remember\n1984, the month was September\nMy first year of high school and every fool knows\nYou had to dress fresh and look hype in your school clothes\nI had the clothes with something added\nA gold name plate when a few people had it\nNow that was trouble, cause you would get robbed\nOn the bus goin home, by a crazy large mob\nThey'd sneak on the back of the bus and they looked\nFor somethin they wanted, what they found was what they took\nOne day they found me, standin in the lane\nThey didn't hesitate to say, \"Shorty, run your chain\"\nBefore I could fight someone snatched it and jetted\nEveryone was a victim and I'll never forget it\nWord, man\nThem times were kinda rough, man\nYo Ace, you remember times like that, man?\n\n[ VERSE 4: Master Ace ]\nYeah, I can remember like back then, son\nYou didn't have to worry about a knife or a gun\nYou balled up your fist like a man and fought your fight\nAnd kept your left up if your brother taught you right\n(Word) Back then, a fist was your best weapon\nSo you threw up your hands instead of just steppin\nAnd if you lost, you lived to fight another day\nI heard a brother say now there's no other way\nTo win a fight except to use a bullet\n\"The trigger makes me feel bigger when I pull it\"\nHe said, I just shook my head at this\nAnd that's what made me wanna reminisce\n\n( *knocking* )\n\nYo come in\nOh yo, it's my dancers, the Big Steps in the house\nMy man Shawn, S Boogie\nMy man Glaze in the house\n(Always chillin, yo\nWhat's up y'all, how y'all doin man, y'all coolin?)\n(Of course, I'm always chillin)\nYo, y'all ain't gon' believe who's in the house\nY'all ain't gon' believe who's in the house\n(Oh shit)\nYo, tell em who's in the house\nThe Big Steps, the Big Steps\nThe Big Steps, Big Steps, the Big Steps\nThe Big Steps, the Big Steps\nThe Big Steps, Big Steps, the Big Steps..\n( *shout outs * )\n...damn, why you gotta 'motherfucker' on everything?\nI don't care\nWord up, I ain't havin it\nWhose mother you're bonin?\nI know you're bonin somebody's..1Embed"

The capital A's your man\nI'll inspire you to strive a little higher\nYou won't tire, and not even barbwire\nWill obstruct your progress, I guess\nYou wanna succeed? Determination is what you need\nFace your fears and place your tears aside\nRaise your peers to the top, here's a guide\nFor you to follow by, try and swallow my\nFood for thought, and you're short of an alibi\nThere's no excuses, the rhyme just spruces\nAnd juices up a small mind, so call mine the loosest\nCause I get looser than mice in a basement\nI grab the mic, and that's when the place went\nWild, Steady smiled, I didn't crack one\nNot that I'm mean or that I lack fun\nBut the topic is serious, listeners are curious\nRappers are lerious, the Ace and I'm furious\nIt's not the kinda rage that makes me wanna rant and rave\nAcross the stage like a beast in a cage, I save\nAll the screamin and shoutin for the next man\nThe look on my face is the proof that I'm vexed, and\nI don't yell, I don't swell, I tell facts\nAnd simply stated I made it, sell tracks\nBut I want respect from those who chose to\nFlap your rat traps, cause heaven knows you\nMade a mistake when you chose to oppose\nYou tried to step on toes, now you're dissed - case closed\nCause like it or not, Action is gettin there\nSo keep on sittin there, riffin and splittin hair\nAnd critizisin, I got my eyes in\nAn upward glance, and I see us all risin\nTogether\nYou might also like[ Hook ]\n\nListen up\nWho says a brother can't get his with his\nEyes on the prize, realize that it is\nHighly probable that someday he will\nBelieve and therefore achieve, but we will\nKeep an eye out, cause he might try out\nA quicker way to payday, but I doubt\nThe brother knows: the harder the wind blows\nThe faster the quick cash goes, and I suppose\nGettin paid everyday means improvement\nBust the movement on the floor as the groove went\n(Together) as the bass kicked, the Ace picked\nThe mic up, and now I'm gonna strike up a taste licked\nBy a licker and bitten by a biter\nSucked by a sucker, I fought like a fighter\nTo get the meal rarely barely shared by\nA brother of color, but I'm not scared, I\nDon't wanna stop, to the top it's a rat race\nOr should I say rap race, I wanna get that taste\nMy mouth is waterin, who's that orderin?\nThe Ace'll slow a pace, I'm almost borderin\nOn breakin, cause it's there for the takin\nAnd I'm not fakin, yo, I want the bacon\nBut I'm not hurryin or worryin, there's time for\nMe to get mine, but I made a rhyme for\nTo use, so you score, it's more like food for\nEmpty spaces, now the Ace is in the mood for\nSeein the black with a tack with a feather\nCause we don't need a 2x4 just to get there together\nYeah, yeah stopEmbed"
