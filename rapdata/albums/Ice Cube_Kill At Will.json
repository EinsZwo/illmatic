This is Los Angeles, a city with many claims on America, including this one: It is now the gang capital of the nation. Last year alone there were 452 gang-related murders in the  greater Los Angeles area. And we'll see if there is anything that can be done about all of this.\"\n\n[Verse 1: Ice Cube]\nPeace!? - don't make me laugh!\nAll I hear is motherfuckers rappin' succotash\nLivin' large, tellin' me to get out the gang\nI'm a nigga, gotta live by the trigga\nHow the fuck do you figgure?\nThat I can say peace and the gunshots will cease?!\nEvery cop killer goes ignored\nThey just send another nigga to the morgue!\nA point scored- they could give a fuck about us\nThey rather catch us with guns and white powder!\nIf I was old, they'd probably be a friend of me\nSince I'm young, they consider me the enemy!\nThey kill ten of me to get the job correct\nTo serve, protect, and break a niggas neck\n'Cause I'm the one with the trunk of funk\nAnd \"Fuck tha Police\" in the tape deck\nYou should listen to me 'cause there's more to see\nCall my neighborhood a ghetto 'cause it houses minorities\nThe other color don't know you can run but not hide\nThese are tales from the darkside...\n[Chuck D]\nAll of us are endangered, DAMN!\n(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)\n(A young nigga got it bad cause I'm brown)\n\n[Verse 2: Ice Cube]\nYou wanna free Africa, I stare at yuh\n'Cause we ain't got it too good in America\nI can't fuck with them overseas\nMy homeboy died over a key of cocaine\nIt was plain and simple\nThe 9mm went (gunshot sound) to the temple\n(gunshot sound) (gunshot sound) was the sound I put the bitch down\nAnd ran to the schoolyard bathroom\nLooked in the trash can, yo it had room\nSo I ducked my ass in it for a minute!\nCovered with trash I had to lay back\nMad as fuck!\nThinkin' about the payback\nTonight the crew gonna have a little fun\nI went home and cut the barrel of my shotgun\nIt's gettin critical - I stole a 5.0\nI let it go - drive real slow\nI yelled out 'Ice Cube sucka'\nThe shot-gun kicked - and it murdered motherfuckers\nI told you last album\nWhen I got a sawed-off, bodies are hauled off\nIt's a shame, that niggas die young\nBut to the light side it don't matter none\nIt'll be a drive by homicide\nBut to me it's just another tale from the darkside...\nSee Ice Cube LiveGet tickets as low as $62You might also like[Sampled guitar riff]\n\n[Verse 3: Chuck D]\nStanding in the middle of war\nIn the middle we flex\nWhen we die, we won't make Jet\nEbony can't see to the lightside\nThe term they apply to us is a nigga\nCall it what you want, cause I'm comin\u2019 from the corner\nSame applies with a Ph.D\nWho's black - don't wanna roll - sells his soul\nWatch his head go rollin\u2019\nWho the fuck are they foolin\u2019?\nNobody knows, but I suppose the color of my clothes\nMatches the color of the one on my face\nAs they wonder whats under my waist\n(Standin' on the verge) of them gettin\u2019 brown\nThat's a fact\nGot a fear of the bozack\nRun, run, run, their ass off, they can not hide\nYet Cube, they can't fuck with the\nDarkside!1Embed"

Jocking ain't healthy\nCause you think that I'm young and I'm wealthy\nWith juice, so I see you try to run behind\nBut I'mma tell you, punk, you gets none of mine\nCause I was taught, see a fool, use a fool\nBy the niggas who terrorized the old school\nSo don't try me or buy me a beer\nJust stay off my dick, nigga4Embed"

Cause I'm down in a suit and tie\nThey killed a homie that I went to school with (Damn!)\nI tell ya life ain't shit to fool with\nI still hear the screams from his mother\nWhile my nigga laid dead in the gutter (Shit!)\nAnd it's getting to my temple\nWhy is that the only time black folks get to ride in a limo?\nIt makes me so mad I want to get my sawed-off\nAnd have some bodies hauled off\nBut no, I pay my respects and I'm through\nHug my crew, (whaddup Cube?) and maybe shed a tear or two\nThen I wanna get blitzed\nGrab my 40 ounce and then I reminisce\nAbout a brother who had to be the one and only\nSo I dedicate this to my dead homiez\n[Verse 2]\nAnother homie got murdered on a shakedown {3 gun shots}\nAnd his mother is at the funeral, havin' a nervous breakdown\nTwo shots hit him in the face when they blasted {2 gun shots}\nA framed picture and a closed casket\nA single file line about 50 cars long\nAll driving slow with they lights on\nHe got a lot of flowers and a big wreath\nWhat good is that when you're six feet deep?\nI look at that shit and gotta think to myself\nAnd thank God for my health\nCause nobody really ever know it\nWhen it's gonna be they family on the front row\nSo I take everything slow, go with the flow\nAnd shut my motherfuckin' mouth if I don't know(Word!)\nCause that's what Pops told me\nBut I wish he could have said it...to my dead homiez\n\n[Verse 3]\nI remember we painted our names on the wall for fun\nNow it's \"Rest in Peace\" after every one\nExcept me, but I ain't the one to front\nSeems like I'm viewin' a body after every month\nPlus, I knew him when he was yea big\nPour beer on the curb before I take a swig\nBut somethin' ain't right\nWhen it's a tragedy, that's the only time that the family's tight\nLovin' each other in a caring mood\nThere's lots of people and lots of food\nThey say \"Be Strong\" and you're tryin'\nBut how strong can you be when you see your Pops cryin'?\nSo that's why Ice Cube's dressed up\nBecause the city is so fuckin' messed up\nAnd everybody is so phony\nTake a little time...to think about your dead homiezSee Ice Cube LiveGet tickets as low as $62You might also like6Embed"
