don't give a fuck I do a thou-wow then I'm up and down\nTo break that shit and weigh that shit distribute shit out Grandma's house\nEveryday at the block with the chop in my coat\nAlways been always be all my life, always dope\nI don't give a fuck I do a thou-wow then I'm up and down\nTo break that shit and weigh that shit distribute shit out Grandma's house\nEveryday at the block with the chop in my coat\nAlways been always be all my life, always dope\n(I know how real it is homie\nThat's why I make people feel the hook, man\nWhere would we be without our Grandmas?\nA lot of our Grandma's was our Mamas)\n\n[Verse 1]\nClose your eyes and imagine the south\nLittle black boy at his Grandma's house\nCount stacks for a quarter of an ounce\nTrying to get the brand new Jordans came out\nTrying to get the candy paint Chevy up out\nBills paid shop say it cost three thou\nIt'll be worth it when I hit the block\nHaters gonna hate, but the women gon' jock\nBarely sixteen with a dope man dream\nSince thirteen with a flea market ring\nMe and my brother buying fake-ass gold\nTrying to impress them fake-ass hoes\nY'all niggas know y'all seen it before\nUp real late with your Grandma's plate\nPraying to god she don't hear that scrape\nPraying to god that she don't wake\n--If she catch me serving hard\nIt's gon' break my Nana's heart\nSo I take them nicks\nI cut 'em quick and hit the boulevard--\nThat yay and a K on MLK\nHail from the four but I'm known in the trey\nKiller from the 'Ville in a Chevrolet\nBumping 'Pocket Full of Stones' by UGK\nThat was my life circa nine trey\nYou should see the fat black boy today\nWear more Polo than Kanye\nMarry me a big booty cutie like Jay\nHood boss, nigga, do shit my way\nFuck I care what a critic got to say?\nFuck they know about Atlanta though?\nFuck they was at in '94?\nYou might also like[Hook]\nI don't give a fuck I do a thou-wow then I'm up and down\nTo break that shit and weigh that shit distribute shit out

south\nCouple new cars at my Grandma's house\nEverything I wear tailor-made or Ralph\nEvery woman on my team is stout\nEvery nigga on my team about\nGetting to the money\nGetting to the paper\nGetting out the west side into Decatur\nWe pumped base like Cerwin Vegas\nWe rolled trees in a Garcia Vega\nNineteen the street king took trips to Vegas\nServed 18 before I hopped that plane\nLanded in Vegas and copped that Jane\nRented a Benz and switched that lane\nMy Cali bitch she broke that brain\nHit her from the back and bent that frame\nMy life dope --Straight Cocaine--\nHit the town my pockets fat\nSeven hours later lost seven stacks\nLeft the dice alone did Black Jack\nA few 21s brought the seven back\nBut luck is a lady we know that\nAnd sometimes that ho hold back\nWhen I needed her most that bitch got ghost\nI lost them seven plus four back\n--Staring at heaven like I lost eleven you should have seen your nigga's faaace\nThe OG was with me and he dropped fifty we laugh about it to this daaay--\nTold the young 'un, \"I knew you would grow to be a G in this game\nBecause the next day your wife came with thirty bands on a plane\"\n[Hook]\nI don't give a fuck I do a thou-wow then I'm up and down\nTo break that shit and weigh that shit distribute shit out Grandma's house\nEveryday at the block with the chop in my coat\nAlways been always be all my life, always dope\nI don't give a fuck I do a thou-wow then I'm up and down\nTo break that shit and weigh that shit distribute shit out Grandma's house\nEveryday at the block with the chop in my coat\nAlways been always be all my life, always dope\n\n[Verse 3]\nClose your eyes and imagine the south\nBentley GT at my Grandmama house\nAin't worried about what the law talk about\nBecause I went legit, the game I'm out\nBuilt my own company like Eazy-E\nWe Ruthless my nigga, the G to the T\n--Grandmama told me to slow my roll\nStack my money pay child support\nI smiled and said, \"Look Mama, I know\nBut them women are still gon' be at my throat.--\nNo matter what Mama they gon' want some more\nMad they can't have a nigga no more\"\nDisturbing my life, threatening my wife\nOne of them tried to stick me with a knife\nKnocked her ass out and threatened to kill her\nMy Grandmama told me the devil was in her\nShe told me, \"Young 'un just stay away from her\nDon't talk to her brother, don't talk to her Mama\nLet her get her mind right really quick\"\nI kicked her ass out like 50 did\nHuh... I'm still the shit\n99 problems and not one bitch\nWill ever take a young player off his grind\nWhen I grab my dick, see my pinkie shine...\n\n[Hook]\nI don't give a fuck I do a thou-wow then I'm up and down\nTo break that shit and weigh that shit distribute shit out Grandma's house\nEveryday at the block with the chop in my coat\nAlways been always be all my life, always dope\nI don't give a fuck I do a thou-wow then I'm up and down\nTo break that shit and weigh that shit distribute shit out Grandma's house\nEveryday at the block with the chop in my coat\nAlways been always be all my life, always dopeEmbed"

You got three points left\nNow how you gonna let that bitch ball and stunt?\nShit, I might as well fuck the dyke bitch myself\nGet my hands on all of that there white myself)\nHer jazzy mouth damn near made be smack the broad\nBut she smart for a bagger broad\nPlus she got a body that'll help me bag and rob this dyke broad\nYou might also like[Hook]\n[Refrain]\n\n[Verse 3]\nBrought the plan together with major deception\nHad Black call up Lexi at the west end\nTold her that she stole my phone\nAnd she was trying to get to her before I got home\nThe fat bitch catfished, yeah she took bait\nSet up a rendezvous with my boo at eight\nTwenty minutes later I called Lexi\nSaid \"Bitch, we straight\nI got five young broads for you ready to shake\nI'm about to come get you, you ready to skate?\"\nShe said \"Naw, I'm hungover, I got a headache\"\nWent to Black, told her \"Baby we straight\nLet her eat it 'til she sleeping then open the door\nShe gonna awake to duct tape, face down on the floor\"\nSure did, she awoke to my .44\nLooking all confused, staring at my ho\nSeen tears in her eyes that was oh-so-hazy\nTold her \"Bitch, God said don't covet your neighbor\nYou dance with the Devil, you will be disabled\nBitch, I'm a beast and this my bishe\nAll we do is walk the earth and eat the weak\"\nShe said \"Mike how you gon' do this shit to me?\nWe been doing good business since at least '03\"\nI told her \"Bitch, be a man, this is M.O.B.\"\nThe dumb dyke began to lick cause she thought it was a dick\n[Outro]\n(\"How my hair look Mike?\")\n\"You look good girl\"\n*gunshot*\n\n[Refrain]Embed"
