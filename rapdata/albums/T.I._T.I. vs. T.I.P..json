Geter keep callin the heat\nIs it an emergency or somethin you need to talk to me?\nJ said - \"I thought you needed to talk to me\nIf it's a change made aware I think it ought ta be\nYou makin ultimatums now you don't talk to me\nYou make shit way worse then it ought ta be\nI ain't arguin on the phone, come talk to me\nI'll be waitin on you dawg at the office, peace\"\nNow, thinkin hard as I walk out my house\nWhat the fuck have I done now, what could he be talkin 'bout?\nI been stayin outta trouble, shit I been on the couch\nJust workin on the album, I was listenin now\nThen, Doug called (ay you spoke to J?)\nYeah is it somethin I don't know that I was supposed to say?\nAll I know is for the hour I been woke today\nNiggas comin with the riddles and the jokes today\nI'm real close to J, I seen ups and downs hit\nBut I ain't never heard him sound the way that he sounded\nReally caught a nigga by surprise, I was astounded\nHe a real cool dude but why he call me clownin?\n[Doug Peterson] + (T.I)\nYou sayin you don't know 'bout it? (Know 'bout what?)\nAtlantic Records said you called the office and went nuts\nMakin death threats talkin loud gettin buck\n(Man they said I did what? Folk I'm just gettin up!)\nSay you waitin out your deal 'til you year is up\nYou plannin to make away with 20 million bucks\n(You bullshittin me right? Is you serious bruh?)\nYeah they said from now on they'd rather deal with us\nI talked to Craig, Jules and Kys' a long time\nLong story short they said you done lost ya damn mind\nAnd they runnin off deeper across ya deadline\nYou crossin a thin line, don't give 'em a deadline\nOr they suin the shit up out ya, they don't give a shit about ya\nSaid you ain't doin nothin they couldn't have done without ya\nMan you ain't never been hotter, worked a whole lotta\nYears and came up to go way back to the bottom, what\n\n[Repeat to fade]\nHustle pimp, hustle pimp\n\n[Outro: T.I.]\nMan, the hell is y'all talkin 'bout?\nI been in the house all night\nI don't know nothin 'bout that shit man\nI got the album right here!\nMan send this to 'emYou might also likeEmbed"

This dope got me geeked up\nI went to Japan and made a mil' in a week bruh\nThese niggas can't keep up when they see me in London\nOr out in Ibiza, that time I ain't sleep for\nBout three days maybe, you see me in Haiti\nWith Wyclef Jean and a selection of ladies\nBut my folk got that work in like they back in the 80's\nSee the money's what move me, conversation don't phase me\n[Hook: Wyclef Jean] + (T.I.)\n(Tell 'em why cause I) Been around the worrrrrld\nTraveled the seven seas (and I be)\nPoppin bottles with celebrities (so you can find me)\nFlyin high, smokin better trees (ay, oh-ay-ay)\nGirls around the worrrrrld (yo, yo)\nThey keep callin me (they call me)\nPaparazzi they be follow me (they all be)\nHopin that they get a shot of me\nIt's my swaaaaag (they wonder what's so special 'bout him)\n(Why they ain't sellin records like him, tell 'em)\nIt's my swaaaaag (how he always look so cool)\n(That why e'rybody do what he do, tell 'em)\nGotta be my swaaaaag (they wonder why he wear his hat like that)\n(When girls see him why they act like that, ay, I don't know)\nIt's my swaaaaag (for some reason all the real niggas love him)\n(Even though they girlfriend wanna fuck him, I guess)\nGotta be my swaaaaag\n\n[T.I.]\nGettin money in Frisco, wearin my raincoat\nSee I'm gettin wet, and this bitch in the same boat\nI came in the game slow, they act like they ain't know\nThat I wasn't gon' leave until I got what I came fo'\nI still can't complain though, as long as I ain't broke\nI came a long way but shawty ain't nuttin changed though\nI still let the tool go, don't get it confused bro\nRun up on me wrong, now what you think I'mma do bro?\nSend you to your maker, then go to Jamaica\nOr either to Cabo, I chill at my condo\nMy swagger is perfect, hatin on me ain't worth it\nGuarantee you boy, the Earth my turf, if it hurts\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[T.I.]\nRegardless what haters say I'm as real as they come\nI'm chasin that paper baby however it come\nFrom singing this song to moving yay by the ton\nI bet you never seen a nigga gettin money so young\nHow I get from the pen', all the way to Berlin\nI've been to Switzerland skiing and pimp I'm goin again\nIt ain't nuttin to catch me in the south of France\nIn a coffee shop smokin dro in Amsterdam\nAnd ain't nuttin to fly, all the way to Dubai\nSt. Barts, St. Lucia, any day we can try\nG-5 to Moscow and they say I'mma lie\nI'mma ball like a dog 'til the day that I die\n\n[Hook] w/ ad libs\n\n[Outro: T.I.]\nThis is impeccable pimpin\nYou couldn't duplicate this shit if I told you how to man\nHahhh, y'all niggas keep up\nBy the time you get to Puerto Rico my nigga I'll be in Cuba\nBy the time you get to Cuba I'll be in Haiti\nBy the time you get to Haiti I'll be way over in Africa man\nY'knowmsayin? South of France in my land man\nThe Earth's my turf my nigga {*fades out*}Embed"

(Think I'm lyin)\nSay goodbye to the bad guy!\nYou don't appreciate a nigga my type\nOnce I die ain't no mo' niggas my type\nSo just remember me right (you ain't gotta worry 'bout me no mo')\nJust remember me right, hey just remember me right\nHey just remember me right, just remember me right\n(But you gon' see is far worse than out there, hey!)\n[Hook: T.I.]\nBet you don't appreciate a nigga my type\nCause when I die ain't no mo' niggas my type, so just remember me right\nBet if I let them suckas kill me tonight\nAll them haters gon' be filled with delight, God forgive me, aight?\nI sacrifice so they could live my life\nIf necessary I'd give my life, so what you here in my life\nReputation decorated with stripes\nNo need for cryin at the end of my life, hey just remember me right\n\n[T.I. - over Hook]\nYou'll see...\nI see you laughin, AY!\nI did this shit for you nigga, it's all good\nHey! You know me homie, ay\n\n[T.I.]\nWhen your back was against the wall remember where could you go\nRemember who helped you again like he helped you befo'\nWent out they way to let you know that you ain't ever alone\nThey disrespect you, you come get who 'til they left you alone\nHe taught you, how to be weak, he taught you how to be strong\nTaught you not to accept defeat, you go all out or be gone\nBet it ain't, the same in the streets now that he gone\nHe now in heaven on the throne exactly where he belong\nNow he left millions devastated and his family mourned\nSons turn to grown men since they daddy been gone\nDaughters grew, like him or not he left his family on\nEven prepaid the funeral service he had in the dome\nAnd there they came to represent, for a stand-up gent\nWho walked it like he talked it, always said what he meant\nImpossible to stop him, had a head like cement\nMaybe now you'll appreciate a nigga like this (they might)\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[T.I. - over Hook]\nAin't gon' be no mo', remember me how I was baby\nI can see you still laughin right now, HEY!\nI made it possible homie\nBut I die for it, it's all good man\nStrong got to lead the weak! Ay\n\n[T.I.]\nIf they had only knew the man outside of the hype\nNo matter what the situation he always try to do right\nStill they gossip to told lies, used to take him for granted\nOften find it hard to relate, somehow they can't understand it\nCause that respect he gon' demand, if there's a problem he handle\nLook adversity in the eye, he never ran from a challenge\nThey tried to knock him off balance when the Feds came and got him\nDid the time on his head, came home, that ain't stop him\nThat's why them niggas used to hate him but they girl used to jock him\nSwear he had the kind of swagger made the world stop and watch him\nPlus he possess so much hustle made it impossible to top him\nGot better every album, haters hate to see him drop 'em\nThey just talk shit from a distance, when he around they playin possum\nHe used to scare them suckas shitless that's probably why them niggas shot him\nAnd what it took ain't nothin else they ever could or did about it\nSo go on, talk shit about him, least you ain't forgot about him\nI see\n[Hook]\n\n[T.I. - over Hook]\nYou'll see! Ain't no more of me man\nHey, hey, hey!\nEnjoy, I did this man\nThat's how I just put the weight on my shoulders\nI carry the load baby, I'm used to it\nI'm built for it! AY!\n\n[T.I.]\nWanna say sorry to my momma, King and Lil' Mama\nSee me go through so much drama, you could stand a lil' thunder\nNever let 'em see you sweat, stay cool as a cucumber\nStay ready for whatever, make 'em know I'mma do wonders\nHow he died? On his feet like a man with honor\nShowed you the sky was the limit, you could do whatever you wanna\nThat's for Bubba and Domani, Deyjah and Neek-Neek\nDon't worry 'bout me, Uncle Phil and Leiah's with me\nSee me wit'cha granddaddy - I know you gon' miss daddy\nBut life ain't always a dream, and horrible shit happens\nHate I let a nigga kill me before I could quit rappin\nAnd get to spend mo' time wit'cha, I know we'da been happy\nBut I had to take in them chances, you probably woulda been trappin\nLong as I could keep that from happenin, ya pappy can die happy\nJust keep the wind at ya back, and the sun at ya face\nRemember winnin in your blood, you were born with what it take, okay?\n\n[Hook]\n\n[T.I. - over Hook]\nHey, that's it for me\nHey, I bet you'd love that, wouldn't you?\nI did this for y'all man\nYou know ain't no favorite man\nMan fuck this shit partner, HEY!\n\n[Outro]\nHey y'all, with all my heart I apologize man I'm sorry\nI tried, I did everythang I could man, y'knowmsayin?\nThere was just more of them than there was me, ya dig?\nThey say you can't win 'em all\nBut shit man, I gave them niggas hell long as I could though bruh\nHeh, and you could put the money on that, HEY!1Embed"
