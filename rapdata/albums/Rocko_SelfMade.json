She only got one thing on her mind and that's my money, that's my money, that's my money\n\nLet's make a movie! My life so cinematic, I'm charismatic. They wanted swag so I'm a let em have it. You gone let em have it? Yeah I'm a let em have it. Swag\nSchool 101, you wanna pay for classes?(You hear that nigga) I got swag for sale, couldn't afford Harvard so I had do Yale. Swag through the door the hoes like fuck yeah. If Im here and you there, who the fuck cares? I told em be easy! Tonight could be your luck night, even a garbage can get a steak bone once or twice. Straight to the back Louis bag to the max. I just came to play baby let's blow a couple stacks\n\nIf you making money know that shawty watchin. If a nigga shinin she tryin to make a profit. Stop tellin me you love me bitch you betta stop it. I don't believe you I see right through you\n\nShe only got one thing on her mind and that's my money, that's my money, that's my money. She only got one thing on her mind and that's my money, that's my money, that's my money\nI'm sleep gettin money. These hoes know I'm gettin money. Money come from everywhere they got me runnin from it. You runnin from the money? Yeah I be runnin from it. These bitches chasin me too, they got me runnin from em. But I ain't stuntin em though unless I'm gettin money from em. The watch will ya make want me. Man I'm sick of money. I'm tired of diggin holes so now I live with money\nI've been gettin money so long I'm sittin on the money. Im tired sittin down, so Im standing on the tables. Saw this bitch from head to toe, hair look like a tomato. Shawty in my ear she say she wanna put it on me. (What you tell her?) Hope she don't think she gettin a penny of my money. Ey!\n\nIf you making money know that shawty watchin. If a nigga shinin she tryin to make a profit. Stop tellin me you love me bitch you betta stop it.

She only got one thing on her mind and that's my money, that's my money, that's my money\n\nAy oh you love me baby, I love you too. She trying stroke my ego so I let her do her do(her do). She seeing dollar signs she see me in all the literatures. She heard about the deal man you know I can't get rid of her. I turn the corner she on my hips she talkin bout she going with me. She fine than a mug but somethin bout this bitch annoyin me. She say she like my songs, she wanna one night me. Whole\nTime she dreamin of me makin her my wifey. Gone with that lame game bitch you ain't slick. This big boss shit who you think you dealing with? And even though I keep a lot of stacks on me. You still ain't gettin a fuckin penny of my money\n\nIf you making money know that shawty watchin. If a nigga shinin she tryin to make a profit. Stop tellin me you love me bitch you betta stop it.

    "lyrics": "Karma LyricsI done a lot of good, I done a lot of wrong, dis real shit, I advise u listen to this song. A nigga robbed me 15 yrs ago(where)\nBack in canridge swats sides on 4, never forget that day, thought it was all g's, but niggas hating man dey hating on a small g\nStuck me witha shank, left a whole in ma face, took my heroin, bone, money, beeper off my waist. Next day I squad up, got all the\nTools out, got a hot bos, roll round lookin for dudes house, lucky for me I ain't catch him, woulda been dead, unlucky for him\nFucked round, he touched the wrong kid, that karm fool, it hit cha from the blind side, he got shot 9 times now he paraylized\nPlz forgive him lord, even a thug pray, but I pray my past don't come back to haunt me\n\n[Chorus:]\nTold me it was destiny, came to me 1 night I was dreamin, dese crazy visions I kept on seeing, all the money and clothes, all\nThe drugs that I sold from the life that I chose, but it could be karma, cause all these things u do it could haunt cha, if u do it wrong it come right back\nOn ya, all the money and clothes, all the drugs that I sold could be the reason u ain't livin tomorrow\nI remember I flexed a nigga for a couple chips, juss being greedy man I ain't even need dat shit, country nigga, he know me from a peice of meat\nBut I had to do it to him man dat nigga was supa sweet, next week u won't believe what happned to me, dem folk came I took a loss on like 400g's, dat\nLil 100stack cost me 300strong, but it's my fault because dat shit I did was dead wrong. Damn y I do dat shit, dat was supa dumb, too late to cry about it\nNow nigga what's done is done, u do bad u get bad, and dats karma buddie, it don't matter where u hide, ain't no runnin from it. I asked myself have I paid for all this\nDirt I done or is it gonna catch up wi me before my time is done, I'm doin good good now, I can honestly say, but I pray my past don't come back to haunt me\n\n[Chorus]\nGenerational curse cause of what my daddy did, wat his daddy did, dat shit sound weird, I know the words so I know that ain't right, forgive me lord, I'm just\nTrynna get my stack right. The bible said he said \"fo was both life and death\"blessings and curses told us choose 4 ourselfs. He told us choose life so we can\nStay blessed so u and yo kids can have different sets. Instead we choose death, u know that curse sign, dat kill a nigga, sell dope, u know that dirt sign. I'm doin\nGood now, I can honestly say, but I pray my past don't come back to haunt me\n\n[Chorus]You might also likeEmbed"
