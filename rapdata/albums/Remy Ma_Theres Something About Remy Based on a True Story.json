Bet you gon love Rem\nYall wanna fuck Rem\nBut yall was saying fuck Rem\nSo now yall just fucked up\nYou might also like[Hook 2x]\n\nI ain't too hard\nThese broads is just too easy\nThat's why everytime I rhyme I be doing 'em greasy\nPlease believe me I'm hot no matter the season I spit\nSo sick the track be sneezing hook be coughing\nGot the whole studio freezing if you hit me and I hit you\nWe still ain't even cause I'm not leaving 'til you stop\nBreathing ain't nothing worst than getting popped for no reason\nI wanna see shot laid out just leaking ya words\nCan't come out cause ya mouth keep bleeding ya\nTanktop burgundy white tee burgundy\nI know yall bitches wishing that them niggas would've murdered me\nRemy Ma\nYou know me if not you heard of me\nThe reason you gon have to invest in plastic surgery\nI'm good with a hood n some tims\nFuck burglary\nMy weed is on the island and my guns is out in Germany\n\n[Hook 2x]Embed"

I know you ain't gon' let nobody do no harm to me\nBut you can't be acting like you fathered me... so I'm asking you, what I'm suppose to do?\n\n[Hook]\n\nMommy you was the one that made me but you didn't raise me\nYou left me all alone I had to hold my own\nBut now I'm all grown and far away from home\nI know you love me but you did me wrong\nI guess it was all the drugs that you was on or the beatings you got from my foul step pops\nRemember the time his punk ass had his nerve to raise his hands to me bitch nigga blacking my eye\nI was wishing he would die but now I wish him life\nI know he seeing me blowing and it's killing him slowly but what kills me is that you watched him hit me, so I'm\nAsking you, what I'm suppose to do?\nYou might also like[Hook]Embed"
