Pray the Lord forgive me\nPray He guides me by for what I'm 'bout to go through\nPray\nYou might also like[Break: Beyonc\u00e9]\nDeliver me in thy righteousness\nAnd cause me to escape\nAnd climb thine air unto me\nSave me thine Lord (pray for me!)\n\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z]\nGeah... Anywhere there's oppression\nThe drug profession flourishes like beverages, refreshing\nAhh! Sweet taste of sin\nEverything I seen made me everything I am\nBad drug dealer or victim, I beg\nWhat came first? Moving chickens or the egg?\nThis is why I be so fresh\nI'm tryna beat life 'cause I can't cheat death\nTreat shame with shamelessness\nAim stainlesses at anuses\nYou know the game this is?\nMove coke like Pepsi, don't matter what the brand name is\nI stand behind mine\nEverything I do, I'm a man behind mine\nI'm not an angel, I'm sure\nBut every night before I lay, I drop my knees to the floor\nAnd I pray\n\n[Outro: Beyonc\u00e9]\nThe name shall endure forever\nThe name shall be continued as long as the sun\nPray for me!\nMen shall be blessed in Him\nAll nations shall call Him blessed\nIn Your name, I pray\nPray for me!\nLord bless us6Embed"

Brooklyn Carter\nWhen I left you for Virginia, it didn't offend you\n'Cause you know I only stepped out to get dinner\nAnd I'm eating, so much, I bought extra\nSo much so that dinner's now turned into breakfast\nI only roll Lexus to hug your road\nI love your corners, I'm half your soul\n\n[Chorus: Lil Wayne & Lil Wayne & Jay-Z]\nHello, Brooklyn, how you doing?\nWhere you going? Can I come too?\nAnd If I can, I'ma be your man\nYou could be my lady and have my baby\nAnd drive my cars, and drive me crazy\nWherever you going, baby girl, just take me\n'Cause I'm so taken if you taken\nI'm just saying, baby, I'm just saying\n\n[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]\nHello, Brooklyn, what's your story?\nShe said she eating on the run, but she ain't Nore'\nShe said she got a man but he ain't worried\nBut baby, I'ma have to rob him like Horry\nShe said she love B.I.G., and she like 2Pac\nAnd when I said Jay-Z, she say, \"It's the Roc!\"\nAnd I'ma leave it like this\u2014like this, like that\nWhere Brooklyn at? Where Brooklyn at?\nHave you seen her?\nAnd when she tell you something, you better believe her\nShe told me she like my New Orleans demeanor\nAnd so, I said, \"Goodbye, Katrina\"\nYou might also like[Bridge: Lil Wayne & Jay-Z]\nAnd \"Hello, Brooklyn!\" Buh-baby, you are\nThe sweetest sight eyes could see\nI said, \"Hello, Brooklyn!\" Buh-baby\nI hope you never say goodbye to me\nI said, \"Hello, Brooklyn!\" Buh-buh-baby, you are (Woo!)\nSo damn fine to me\nAnd I remember the time (Time), place (Place)\nAnd the weather (And, woo!)\nOn the day you said, \"Hi,\" to me\nAnd I say, \"Hello, Brooklyn!\"\n\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z]\nBrooklyn, you crazy; look how you made me\nRazor blades in my mouth, walking 'round, behaving\u2014\nAll demented; black hoodies and Timberland-ed\nAlways scheming\u2014\"You see the gleam on that nigga's pendant?\"\n(Hello, Brooklyn) You bad influence, look what you had me doing\nBut I ain't mad at you (Haha), look at my attitude\nIt says my life's too real, check out my ice grill\nBaby, I'm cold as ice, like I'm from Brownsville\nBut my Bed's in the Stuy, though I'll lie flat in your bush\n'Til we smoke a C.I., \"What up\" to the boy, B.I.?\nYou know I handle B-I, I don't half-step on the 'caine\nAsk the dreads 'bout I, how you gwaan 'so?\nShe like it hardcore, so I grind slow\nIller than Albee Square Mall back in the 9-0\nMy fine ho, we got some victims to catch\nSo in a couple years, baby, I'ma bring you some Nets (Woo!)\n[Chorus: Lil Wayne]\nHello, Brooklyn, how you doing?

I never had that, streets was my second home\nWelcomed me with open arms provided a place to crash at\nA place to study math at, matter of fact, I learned it all\nBurnt it all, this music is where I bury the ashes at\nFlash back, not having much, not having that\nHad to get some challah bread so you can holla back and\nHolla at my Jewish lawyer to enjoy the fruit of letting my cash stack\nAnd just in case a nigga gotta use his rat-tat-tat-tat-tat\nOwn boss, own your masters, slaves\nThe mentality I carry with me to this very day\nFuck rich, let's get wealthy, who else gon' feed we?\nIf I need it, I'ma get it however, God help me\n[Refrain: Jay-Z]\nAnd I don't need no hook for this shit\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm so fa sho', it's no fa\u00e7ade\n\"Stay outta trouble,\" Mama said as Mama sighed\nHer fear, her youngest son be a victim of homicide\nBut I gotta get you outta here momma, or I'ma die\nInside\nAnd either way, you lose me, Mama, so let loose of me\nI got the rein, our direction will soon change\nTo live and die in N.Y. in the hustle game\nHustle 'caine, hustle clothes, or hustle music\nBut hustle hard in any hustle that you pick\nSkinny nigga, toothpick, but, but I do lift\nWeight like I'm using 'roids\nRolls-Royce, keep my movements smooth while maneuvering\nThrough all the manure in the sewer that I grew up in\nChoices we make trying to escape, 'scape\n\n[Refrain: Jay-Z]\nAnd I don't need no hook for this shit\n\n[Verse 3: Jay-Z]\nThis is not for commercial usage\nPlease don't categorize this as music\nPlease don't compare me to other rappers\nCompare me to trappers, I'm more Frank Lucas than Ludacris\nAnd Luda's my dude, I ain't tryna diss\nLike, Frank Lucas is cool, but I ain't trying to snitch\nI'ma follow the rules no matter how much time I'ma get\nI'ma live and die with the decisions that I'ma pick\nSo fuck DeHaven for caving, that's why we don't speak\nMade men ain't supposed to make statements\nEnd of the story, I followed the code, cracked the safe\nOther niggas ain't in the game, so they practice hate\nLeave that boy Hov' alone, why don't cha?\nYou don't have to if you don't want to, but don't say I didn't warn you\nYou might also like[Refrain: Jay-Z]\nOh...

How are you gonna kill it? You're gonna become unsuccessful? Frank, you can be successful and have enemies, uh?\nBe unsuccessful too, and even have friends.\"\n\n[Interlude: Jay-Z]\nI got these niggas, Breezy, don't worry about it\nLet that bitch breathe!\n[Verse 1: Jay-Z]\nI used to give a fuck, now I give a fuck less\nWhat do I think of success? It sucks, too much stress\nI guess I blew up quick\n'Cause friends I grew up with\nSee me as a premie, but I'm not, and my nuts big\nI don't know what the fuss is, my career is illustrious\nMy rep is impeccable; I'm not to be fucked with, with\nShit, let that bitch breathe!\nI'm way too important to be talking about extorting\nAsking me for a portion's like asking for a coffin\nBroad daylight I'll off your on-switch\nYou're not too bright, goodnight, long kiss\nBye bye, my reply... \"BLAH, BLAH\"\nBlast burner, then pass burner to Ty-Ty\nFinish my breakfast, why?\nI got an appetite for destruction and you're a small fry\nNow where was I?\n[Break: Jay-Z]\nLet that bitch breathe!\n\n[Verse 2: Jay-Z]\nI used to give a shit, now I don't give a shit more\nTruth be told I had more fun when I was piss-poor\nI'm pissed off, and this what success is all about?\nA bunch of niggas acting like bitches with big mouths\nAll this stress, all I got is this big house\nCouple of cars, I don't bring half of them shits out\nAll of this Ace of Spade I drink just to piss out\nI mean, I like the taste, could've saved myself 6 hours\nHow many times can I go to Mr. Chow's, Tao's, Nobu?\nHold up, let me move my bowels\nI'll shit on y'all niggas, OG, tell these boys\n(Y'all ain't got shit on my nigga, aoww!)\nI got watches I ain't seen in months\nApartment at the Trump I only slept in once\nNiggas said Hova was over, such dummies\nEven if I fell I'll land on a bunch of money\nY'all ain't got nothing for me\n\n[Break: Jay-Z]\nNas, let that bitch breathe!\n[Verse 3: Nas]\nSuccess, McLaren, women staring\nMy villain appearance\nSacred blood of a king and my vein ain't spilling\nGhetto Othello, Sugar Hill Romello\nCamaro driven, I climax from paper\nThen ask: \"Why is life worth living?\"\nIs it to hunt for the shit that you want?\nTo receive's great, but I lust giving\nThe best jewelers wanna make my things\nI make Jacob shit on Lorraine just to make me a chain\nNiggas mentioned on One Love\nCame home to the paper in hand\nAin't gotta brag about the Feds, young man\nOld cribs I sold, y'all drive by like monuments\nGoogle Earth Nas; I got flats in other continents\nWorst enemies wanna be my best friends\nBest friends wanna be enemies like that's what's in\nBut I don't give a fuck, walk inside the lion's den\nTake everybody's chips, 'bout to cash them in\nUp your catalog, dog, mine's worth too much\nLike Mike Jacks ATV pub, Mottola can't touch\nLet this bitch breathe!
