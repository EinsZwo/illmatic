Get your work up!\n\n[Boots]\nWe are born from the mildew, the rust, the heathenous lust\nThe dreams in the dust, the evidence flushed\nThe grieving is just, they're thieving from us\nInsulted and cussed, this evening we bust\nOur pay's unstable and under the table\nWe like free speech but we love free cable\nWe're taught from the cradle the Bill Gates fable\nWhich leads to high speeds in Buick LeSables\nWe have no excuses just great alibis\nAnd poker faces you can't analyze\nOur politicians sell our soul and our cries\nWith blood on their hands they can't sanitize\nWe're the have-nots, but we're also the gon'-gets\nNot just talkin 'bout the Lex with the chrome kits\nYou can get that by yourself with the four-fifth\nLet's all own shit then toast with Patron hits\n\n[Hook]\n\n(Check it out now)\n\n[Hook]\n\n(Check it out now)\n\n[Interlude]1Embed"

I'm not concerned\nCause y'all got to learn\nIt's y'all turn like Detroit Red\nWhen his head had an ultra perm\nThe long walk will burn your bare heels\nSo throw on your boots\nThe game camouflaged like army suits\nBut I can see it more clear cause I came with the Coup in here\nRing the alarm and form the troops\nSend 'em out into the world, go to war in a fluke\nEye to eye with the enemy you sworn to shoot\nNow I'm comin' at ya neck, sick of hearing something wrong with me\nMotherfucker something's wrong with you\nWith a Chief just way too smart to question\nThe enemy the brothers of a dark complexion\nThe governments of the world is shark infested\nThey heavy on weaponry like Charlton Heston\nMan yeah it gets low here uh, real low\nKnow what I'm talkin' 'bout?\n[HOOK]\n\n[Verse 2 -Boots]\nDeath to the pigs is my basic statement\nI spit street stories 'til I taste the pavement\nTryin' to stay out the pen while we face enslavement\nHad a foolproof hustle 'til they traced the payments\nI was grippin' my palm around some shitty rum\nTryin' to find psalm number 151\nTo forget what I'm owed, as I clutch the commode\nAnd read \"put down the bottle and come get the gun\"\nLet's get off the chain like Kunta Kinte with a MAC-10\nThey want us gone like a dollar in a crack den\nSteadily subtracting seeds & stems\nMind cloudy through the wheeze and phlegm\nNumbing my brain off of that and the Jesus hymns\nIf we waiting for the time to fight, these is thems\nTellin' us to relax while they ease it in. We gettin greased again\nThe truth I write is so cold, It'll freeze my pen\nI'm Boots Riley it's a pleasure to meet you\nNever let they punk ass ever defeat you\nThey got us on the corner wearing pleather and see thru\nAll y'all's gold mines they wanna deplete you\nI ain't just finna to rap on the track, I'm finna to clap on 'em back\nAnd it's been stackin' to that\nFive hundred years before Iceberg ever leaned back in the 'lac\nBefore they told Rosa black in the back\nBefore the CIA told Ricky Ross to put crack in the sack\nAnd Gil-Scott tradin' rappin for smack\nThis beat alone should get platinum plaques\nI'd rather see a million of us ecstatic to scrap\nCause if we bappin' 'em back we automatically stacked\nYou might also like[HOOK]\n\n[Verse 3 - Talib Kweli]\nThis the cut like truancy\nRiq, Boots and me\nActivatin' the community\nUp in the bay like Huey P\nAnd sucker free, it remind me of the BKer's love for me\nBut the beast got it twisted, I'll untangle it\nBlack mind intertwined like the ropes they used to hang us with\nThis is my favorite shit, I came in the game with a new way to spit\nThat got you questioning who you bangin' with\nTake it back to Imhotep\nGo a step deeper like a Poor Righteous Teacher with Holy Intellect\nKiller flow for all my real niggas left\nBut inform the family of the jigaboo that there's been a death\nOnce again you can feel hip-hop\nUnderground, still about my guap\nGangsta like, fuck the cops\nTalib Kweli revolutionary MC, and that ain't about to stop\n\n[HOOK]19Embed"

Lyrics[Hook - 2X]\nI love them boosters\nThey love them boosters\nYou should love them too\nEven if they don't know ya\nThey'll get it for ya\nLike a whole outfit or shoe\n\n[Boots Riley]\nA booster is a person who jacks from the retail\nAnd sells it in the hood for dirt-cheap resale\nIn these hard times, they press on like Lee Nails\nIn all of my experience,  their sex has been female\nBack in elementary, my shoes used to rap\nEvery time my soles would hit the street they would flap\nThen in high school Langston Anderson would cap\nCause my jacket didn't have a brand name on the back\nYears later this lady took me to her apartment\nIt looked like the Macy's sportswear department\nClothes on the chairs, on the couch, and the carpet\nA twenty had me icy like pissing in the arctic\nIf it wasn't for the hard work of a booster\nMost couldn't go to the clubs that we're used to\nIf you don't get the dress code they'll boot ya\nLike people who did dress up won't shoot ya\nFor some of y'all folks, this stuff might phase ya\nThis ain't the way the society raised ya\nBut most of it was made by children in Asia\nThe stores make money off of very low wages\nThe next time you see two women running out the Gap\nWith arms full of clothes still strapped to the rack\nOnce they jump in the car, hit the gas and scat\nIf you have to say something, just stand and clap\n[Hook]\n\n[Boots Riley]\nThis goes to all them hard working women\nWho risk jail-time just to make them a living\nWe know there'd probably be no one in prison\nIf rights to food, clothes, and shelter were given\nPlus they be giving me dress so fresh\nEven when my wallet yells, \"S.O.S.\"\nIn a cheaper Sunday suit, you feel a little more blessed\nSo until the revolution that I profess\nMy shirt is from Stacey, my pants are from Rhonda\nMy shoes came out the trunk of a baby blue Honda\nMy wardrobe's in luck if something falls off a truck\nIf you're looking for some leather, then go see Yolanda\nI'm on the red carpet and they ask who designed this\nI'm gonna give a shout-out to Bay Area's finest\nAll on our own, we survive this with slyness\nBut when we come together, all our fashion is flyness\n\n[Hook]You might also likeEmbed"

[repeat]\n\n[Verse 2: Boots]\n\"I have just killed my first but it may not be the last one\"\nI screamed this at the sergeant with his head press to the Magnum\nYou sent us to this country not to free but bodybag them\nAnd free up all their money so accounting firms can add them\nDrag them and their corporates to their own battle\nInstead of sending us to the slaughter like cattle\nMe and the whole unit we will start to ramshackle\nListen very closely you can hear the fire crackle\nYou could weigh the air which he was breathing out his nostrils\nCouldn't understand why we were seeming so hostile\nSaid \"we spread democracy\" like he was preaching gospel\nSlapped him in his head and said \"Now shut up, Sergeant Roscoe!\"\nIf this is not explicit, lemme tell ya straight out\nWe'll no longer kill to keep this country drained out\nWe want up outta here like on the next planes out\nTell the Cap'n make it happen, or we'll blow his brains out!\"\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\nGet yo' ass off the flo' [repeat]Embed"
