Yeah\nSeems like I gotta by the end of the week (so easily sidetracked!)\nI think it mighta been next week\nMighta been next month, shit (Joey!)\n\nLook, sometimes I wanna make money\nBut sometimes I ain't motivated; sometimes I think it's overrated\nSometimes I'm thinkin I wasn't supposed to make it\nBut what I show is basic, I normally poker-face it (what else?)\nSometimes I wanna make music\nSometimes I think it's just useless\nSo y'all don't hear a lot of new shit\nClueless, dependin on what my mood is (ohh!)\nSometimes I wanna dress down\nI mean I wanna let up, but y'all be let down\nI'm so easily sidetracked\nI just lost my train of thought, but besides that\nI wanna stop somebody and keep it real\nBut know that they'll understand 'fore I tell 'em how I feel\nI wish I knew how to feel\nI swore I needed somethin from the store (like what?)\nGot a call that I just ignored, my day is hectic\nI'm overwhelmed with thoughts, leave a message\nThis Saturday I, planned on goin shoppin for my kid\nWanna smoke, no cig's, I'm like \"Where the fuck's the store?\"\nGot a migraine, but I forgot that I was sick\nCause these jeans don't seem to lay right over my kicks\nAnd this'll be the last time I buy this brand\nThat I try this brand - oh shit, the bitch called me\nShe seems like the perfect girl to cheat with\nSleep with, I bet that she can keep a secret\nI turned the radio on, and heard a beat sick\nKnow I can kill that shit better than he did\nSometimes I could be so analytical (why?!)\nWith no audience, so who am I a critic to? (nobody)\nI'm so easily sidetracked\nI just lost my train of thought, but besides that\nI spent years tryin to figure out why is that\nBeat of my drum thrown off by a hi-hat (ohh!)\nI should hit the club, get a outfit\nBut fuck that, the lifestyle ain't about shit\nThat no longer gets me up, it don't arouse shit (why?)\nSee I'm on my OnDemand in the house shit\nI've lost so many relationships\n(Tell me) Is it, just because I don't relate to shit?\nMe I (me I) I hate ignorance so much\nI'm prayin for niggas that didn't grow much\nMaybe our whole generation was raised wrong\nI'm only responsible for me, I gotta stay strong\nI'm so easily sidetracked\nI just lost my train of thought, but besides that\nI spent years tryin to figure out why is that\n... Why? But besides that\nUh uhh, I'm so easily sidetracked!\nUhh, goin on nigga, I spent years tryin to figure out why is that\nWhy? I mean, I'm so easily sidetracked\nFuck is goin on?\n\nYo, cig's still unlit, lookin a pic of a man cross-eyed\nOn my way to kill the nigga 'til the thought died (uhh)\nOr it's a lie, I'm just hogtied\nGot frog eyes, cause chick with a phatty walked by\nNice complexion, nice tan\nAnd so behind her I ran 'til I seen her desination was a man\n(So) In the street I stand, with my heat in hand\nFor what reason, I don't remember beefin\nNote to self on my hand, \"Get even!\"\nBut I don't remember needin re-venge\nNow anybody comin toward me I'm reachin\nLeg bleedin - (so) fuck it\nI'll retrace my steps followin the path of my blood leakin\nLed me to Juan's house which I visit every weekend\nTo my knowledge, me and him wasn't speakinYou might also likeEmbed"

He ended up with a tapped jaw\nAs for me? I ended up with that bad broad\nDamn, I miss the good ol' days, I wish we had more\n\n[Verse 3]\nMaybe I'm feeling like a kid today\nI mean, I used to want to have a house party watching House Party, Kid & Play\nI had the low tops, kicks and the fades\nI remember my first piece of ass from a hot chick\nSurprised she gave it to me, was shocked I got it\nOl' girl image of me was all ruined\nHad to be thinking \"the fuck's this boy doing?\"\nSo hard I flirted just to be all nervous\nWish she could see me now, I'm so perverted\nI tell her \"I'm so glad I found you\nAre you ready for round two? Or can I mount you?\"\nIn old pics I used to look like a clown dude\nWhen I had know idea what I'd amount to\nA nigga used to be out of control\nMan, I miss the good ol' days, when we had soulYou might also likeEmbed"

And I follow wherever it take me\nInstead of wherever the crew go like Tray Lee\nThey see distinguished\nI see a nigga erasing that fine line between crazy and genius\nGot the jewels out, see I'm on my Colorado shit (but)\nI'd rather put the suit on and not follow it (look)\nEverything is perception (I mean) everything is deception (but)\nBut niggas fuck with him cause I be the exception (look)\nI got a warm reception way before any song hit\nI think too outside of the box to be cornered\nI'm too real to be fickle\nGrounded but too fly to meet a nigga in the middle, too big to be belittled\nWise way beyond my years, here's the motto of a man-child (what?)\nWhy try to fit in when you a standout?\n[Hook]\n\n[Joe Budden]\nUhh, you in that mood yet? Why not?\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook, they said I had to make music that would have the kids fiending, screaming\nMake nothing with a meaning, (but) I ain't know the meaning (ohh!)\nThey told him go Hollywood\nFor a split second thought I probably could (but)\nBut parlayed on, would I be understood?\nThey told me even if you not, able to cop cable\nAnytime you hit the club you better have a table\nTold me they would take me at my worst\nTold me image is everything, so I told 'em I'd obey my thirst (whoa!)\nTold me do what you gotta once you on\nHit the scene, make it rain, I told 'em I'm already in the storm\nEverything's in a uproar (whoa)\nThey told me front, I said \"What for?\" (I mean whoa)\nSaid it again, I said \"Fuck y'all!\"\nI won't succumb to all the stereotypes\nWon't sacrifice me for what the stereo hypes\nThey told me get in where you fit in, this is what's in demand now\nSo I told em why try to fit in when you a standout?\n\n[Hook]\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nI understand something's off about me (but) but nothing's forced bout me\nI never gave a fuck of what a nigga thought about me\nI look down upon what some see as a must\nMaybe I'm regular and the world needs to adjust\nI mean I'm everyday people hood but still formal\nI'm normally abnormal, taking life as a lesson\nI'll leave the past in the past, tomorrow's not promised\nAnd today's just a gift, I guess that's why it's the present\nDid I outgrow me, or shit just didn't stick?\nThe baggier my jeans, the more shit didn't fit\n(But I) Didn't quit, inspired by hate, even with homeless\nWhen you a star you already down with the Joneses\nMy thoughts out loud (I mean)\nSometimes if the leader walk slow enough, he fuck around get lost in the crowd (but)\nBut he ain't gotta speed up, everything will pan out\n(Why?)

Talk to 'em like Imus y'all\nAnd give head to a brother, need a Tylenol\nAnd let's keep what we do on the low\nNo entourage, just a one-man show\nLet's break out from the club around 4\nBut it's just one thing that a nigga must know\nCan we\n[Hook]\nTouch, go, touch and go\nTouch, go, touch and go\nTouch and go, touch, go\nTouch, go, touch and go - HERE WE GO!\n(She said she had a man but so)\n(There's just one thing that I really must know - can we)\nTouch and go, touch, go\nTouch, go (can we) touch and go - HERE WE GO!\n\n[Joe Budden]\nI mean I've been seen the broad, you just met her\nI'm in the 'tel with her, you just text her\nYou just chase her, you just sweat her\nShe played you out, you just let her\nYou just peck her, you protect her\nI don't even understand them gestures\nI undress her, throw her on the dresser (and)\nNormally the room like like Esther\nBut if she act up, gotta check her\nR.L. +Next+ her, that's just my regular\nEt cetera, my service like Federer\nThe Rodger cat, now do you roger that?\nLet's keep what we do on the low\nNo entourage, just a one-man show\nLet's break out from the club around 4\nBut it's just one thing that a nigga must know\nCan we\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[Joe Budden]\nHow you doin tonight?\nMatter fact, what you doin tonight?\nIf the answer's nothin\nI'm hopin us two could get into somethin\nSo let me know what you doin tonight\nOr, maybe I'm what you doin tonight\nCall me up naked when she home alone\nAnd make the tone long, now that's the phone bone\nLook - I ain't gotta compliment you\nUhh, me bein me compliments you\nSo on the balcony or in the tub\nOn the plane join the Mile High Club\nFrom the club to the bathroom stall\nWhenever we'll hook up she ain't wearin no drawers\nOoh baby I likes it raw\nBut keep that behind closed doors, my door\n\n[Hook] - 2XEmbed"

Gotta turn around\nShow \u2018em ya game face\nI tell \u2018em we was on the same track but wasn\u2019t running that same race\nWe ain\u2019t in the same space, but I ain\u2019t gonna change pace\nSomething won\u2019t let me slow down, I can\u2019t explain fate\nSo don\u2019t say I went from broke to bourgeois\nI\u2019m far from high end, I just know what suits me\nMa\u2019fucka!\n\n[Hook]Embed"
