Bo!)\nIt's going down (Bo!), 'cause I'm around (Bo!)\n50 Cent, you know how I gets down, down\n\n[Chorus]\nWhat up, blood? (What?)\nWhat up, cuz? (What?)\nWhat up, blood? (What?)\nWhat up, gangsta?\nWhat up, blood? (What?)\nWhat up, cuz? (What?)\nWhat up, blood? (What?)\nWhat up, gangsta?\n\n[Verse 1]\nThey say I walk around like I got a S on my chest\nNah, that's a semi-auto, in a vest on my chest\nI try not to say nothing, the DA might wanna play in court\nBut I'll hunt a duck nigga down like it's a sport\nFront on me, I'll cut you, gun-butt you or buck you\nYou getting money, I can't get nothin' with ya, then fuck ya\nI'm not the type to get knocked for DWI\nI'm the type that'll kill your connect when the coke price rise\nGangstas, they bump my shit, them, they know me\nI grew up around some niggas that's not my homies\nHundred G's, I stash it (What?), the MAC, I blast it (Yeah)\nD's come, we dump the diesel in battery acid\nThis flow's been mastered, the ice, I flash it\nJux me, I'll have your mama picking out your casket, bastard\nI'm on the next level, Breitling baguette bezel\nBenz pedal to the metal, hotter than a tea kettle\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nBlood (What?)\nWhat up, cuz?

(What?)\nWhat up, gangsta?\n\n[Bridge]\nWe don't play that\nWe don't play that\nWe don't play that (G-Unit)\nWe don't play around\n\n[Verse 2]\nI sit back, twist the best bud, burn and wonder\nWhen gangstas bump my shit, can they hear my hunger?\nWhen the fifth kick, duck quick, it sound like thunder\nIn December, I'll make your block feel like summer\nThe rap critics say I can rhyme, the fiends say my dope is a nine\nEvery chick I fuck with is a dime\nI'm like Patti LaBelle, homie, I'm on my own\nWhere I lay my hat's my home, I'm a rolling stone\nCross my path, I'll crush ya, thinking I won't touch ya\nI'll have your ass using a wheelchair, cane, or crutches\nIndustry hoes fuck us, in the hood, they love us\nStomp a bone out your ass with some brand new Chukkas\n[Chorus]\nWhat up, blood? (What?)\nWhat up, cuz? (What?)\nWhat up, blood? (What?)\nWhat up, gangsta?\nWhat up, blood? (What?)\nWhat up, cuz? (What?)\nWhat up, blood?

What the fuck?!\nAh, son, pull off, pull off\n\n[Intro: 50 Cent]\nMany men wish death upon me\nBlood in my eye, dawg, and I can't see\nI'm tryin' to be what I'm destined to be\nAnd niggas tryin' to take my life away (C'mon)\nI put a hole in a nigga for fuckin' with me\nMy back on the wall, now you gon' see\nBetter watch how you talk when you talk about me\n\u2018Cause I'll come and take your life away\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nMany men\nMany, many, many, many men\nWish death 'pon me\nLord, I don't cry no more\nDon't look to the sky no more\nHave mercy on me\nYou might also like[Verse 1: 50 Cent]\nNow man, these pussy niggas puttin' money on my head\nGo on and get your refund, motherfucker, I ain't dead\nI'm the diamond in the dirt that ain't been found\nI'm the underground king, and I ain't been crowned\nWhen I rhyme, somethin' special happened every time\nI'm the greatest, somethin' like Ali in his prime\nI walk the block with the bundles\nI've been knocked on the humble\nSwing the ox when I rumble, show your ass what my gun do\nGot a temper, nigga, go 'head, lose your head\nTurn your back on me, get clapped and lose your legs\nI walk around, gun on my waist, chip on my shoulder\nTill I bust a clip in your face, pussy, this beef ain't over\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nMany men\nMany, many, many, many men\nWish death 'pon me\nLord, I don't cry no more\nDon't look to the sky no more\nHave mercy on me\nHave mercy on my soul\nSomewhere my heart turned cold\nHave mercy on many men\nMany, many, many, many men\nWish death 'pon me\n[Verse 2: 50 Cent]\nSunny days wouldn't be special if it wasn't for rain\nJoy wouldn't feel so good if it wasn't for pain\nDeath gotta be easy, \u2018cause life is hard\nIt'll leave you physically, mentally, and emotionally scarred\nThis is for my niggas on the block twistin' trees in cigars\nFor the niggas on lock doin' life behind bars\nI don't say \"Only God can judge me,\" \u2018cause I see things clear\nCrooked-ass crackers will give my black-ass a hundred years\nI'm like Paulie in Goodfellas, you can call me the Don\nLike Malcolm by any means with my gun in my palm\nSlim switched sides on me, let niggas ride on me\nI thought we was cool, why you want me to die, homie?\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nMany men\nMany, many, many, many men\nWish death 'pon me\nLord, I don't cry no more\nDon't look to the sky no more\nHave mercy on me\nHave mercy on my soul\nSomewhere my heart turned cold\nHave mercy on many men\nMany, many, many, many men\nWish death 'pon me\n[Verse 3: 50 Cent]\nEvery night I talk to God, but he don't say nothin' back\nI know he protectin' me, but I still stay with my gat\nIn my nightmares, niggas keep pullin' TECs on me\nPsychic says some bitch done put a hex on me\nThe feds didn't know much when 'Pac got shot\nI got a kite from the pens that told me Tut got knocked\nI ain't gon' spell it out for you mu'fuckas all the time\nAre you illiterate, nigga? You can't read between the lines?\nIn the Bible, it says what goes around, comes around\n\"Hommo\" shot me, three weeks later he got shot down\nNow it's clear that I'm here for a real reason\n\u2018Cause he got hit like I got hit, but he ain't fuckin' breathin'\n\n[Chorus: 50 Cent]\nMany men\nMany, many, many, many men\nWish death 'pon me\nLord, I don't cry no more\nDon't look to the sky no more\nHave mercy on me\nHave mercy on my soul\nSomewhere my heart turned cold\nHave mercy on many men\nMany, many, many, many men\nWish death 'pon me131Embed"
