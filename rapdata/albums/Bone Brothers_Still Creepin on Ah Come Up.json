Bone)\nYeah, I remember back in the days\nWhen we was \"Creepin on ah Come Up\", we was tryin'a get paid\nBefore a nigga really came of age\nWe was walkin with a trench on, totin that gauge\nHigh tech boots on, blue khaki suits on\nBailin through the snow, tryin'a serve them rocks\nGot a \"Pocket Full of Stones\" like UGK\nLittle dudes gettin money up on the block\nRunnin from the cop car, never really got far\n'Cept for the time when they tried to knock sparks out-\n-My aaasssssss\nGot me thinkin to myself, how long will it last?\nMovin so quick, shit, livin through the hit-list\nEast '99, we was young, black, gifted\nBone Thugs niggas, didn't want none niggas\nCause they already knew how them Thug boys kicked it\nPistols sick, when we was drunk and high\nLittle bitty niggas that loved to fight\nIf somethin went down, didn't rub me right\nStill to this day, somebody gon' die\nBullets gon' fly, my word is my honor\n'Round my way, you gotta walk the walk\nOn some real talk, have ya outlined in chalk\nAll I gotta say is, it ain't my fault\nCan't be bought, takin no loss\nStill to this day, I'm the bill collector\nCome wrong to the Bone, and I gots to check ya\nAutomatic weapon is my selection\nDon't need protection, we'll fuck you up\nBig Buck is my nigga, don't press ya luck\nAnd y'all still ain't ready to fuck with us\nCause in thugs we trust, and we mean it!\n(Hook, Layzie Bone) [Bizzy Bone]\nBooone, Booone, Bone, Bone\n[Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day]\nB-O-N-E, we got it goin ooooonnnnnn, ooonnn, onn, Booone\n[Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day]\nB-O-N-E, we got it goin ooooonnnnnn, ooonnn, onn, Booone\n[Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day]\nB-O-N-E, we got it goin ooooonnnnnn, ooonnn, onn, Booone\n[Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day]\nB-O-N-E, we got it goin ooonnn\n\n(Verse 2, Bizzy Bone)\nOutta my mind, akin the way I think, to the main-frame of game\nBang-bang, gotta get down for my thang\nShame game, stuck in ruts, ready to fuck?\nPut a simple sepena, but give 'em thumbs up\nSeven is a sample, but a sign of the time\nFly fast, give me whip up in a cup\nAnd a dime, and a bag, and a swisher for my nigga\nIn the middle with the Henny, with the heifer with the bald head, long hair\nSome here, it's all here, all, yeah\nMan I'ma call here, call here, it's all here, walk here\nRun here, gone with the wind, and never comin again, then shiiit\nGive it on up, give it away\nKids, listen to the words I say\nPray like everyday, is the only way\nI can focus through the pocus and the games people play\nRun to put the \"Money in a Zip-Lock Bag\"\nUp and away, better move yo ass\nToo many jokes I smoke\nToo many smokes, I know\nToo many loc's that I passed, my past\nCocked in the set, like Aftermath\nSlim shades, lemonade, and a nice squeezed breast\nBalls, look at the close calls\nI told ya dog, because I know ya, dog\nEven when I know you're wrong\nAnd I told the world, all about that hatred\nLook at your small profits, they hate little Bizzy\nAnd you know I'm gonna make it, just better watch that sissy\nSlowly homie, cold and phony, ascended, splended, spend it shawty\nSlowly, I'm more Holy and homie, and Jesus knows\nSee Bone Thugs-N-Harmony LiveGet tickets as low as $64You might also

to tell ya?\nI'm all about success, don't fuck with failures\nNiggas is jealous, and too overzealous\nDon't come in my face and don't talk to my fellas\nWe hellous, rebelious, and definately straight\nSound like we come from a Heavenly place\nThese are the breaks, better make no mistakes\nCause little Lay ain't got no time to waste\nI'ma face the truth, and I'ma raise the roof\nCause this shit here is mine\nI done been around the block about a thousand times\nAnd I done been around the world at least a couple times\nMy rhymes double times, I hit 'em with the rhythm\nWhen we hit 'em

down that's regarding me\nI'ma tell 'em off the rip what this chargin be\nOr the target be, point it straight to ya dome\nI'm tellin you know, just acknowledge the Bone\nI'm sittin at home, and I'm polishin chrome\nReady to bring it onnn\nI handle my business, can I get a witness?\nNiggas is wantin to be me\nNot Mike, but little Stevie\nI'm the one that's makin it look so easy\nEazy-E, tell me can you feel me?\nThe best there is, the best there was\nThe best there ever will be, you'll see\n(Hook, Layzie Bone) [Bizzy Bone]\nBooone, Booone, Bone, Bone\n[Hit 'em with the rhythm like we did it,

overwhelms that stank\nHow could I hate you, when I say thanks?\nI pull away, I roll like tape\nSolely approaching, destroy them snakes\nThoughts in the sand and the grain of the mind\nLike the ring that's around that Saturn line\nStill in my prime, never gon' leave\nNot without Eve and a baby on my sleeve\nBoom-boom, leave\nPut it on Steve\nHolla at g's, please be cordial\nEnjoy yo drank, enjoy yo food\nSay what you more-so, murder that torso\nI put a quarter on my brothers and flowers and trees\nEnemies good, baby boy breathe\nThink to save ya\nFor the light, yes I believe\nBefore I leave, take this money in peace\nAbraham style, watch that beast\nJudas is forgiven, re-livin, now keep it in preach\nIn this world, you must have you some breast, balls\nAnd have you a couple of brawls, yeah\nYou know what we gon' do\nHit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day\nHit 'em with the rhythm like we did it, like back in the day-day-day\nSee Bone Thugs-N-Harmony LiveGet

B is with me\nI speak to him and he speaks with me when everyone is leavin me\nBut, we've gotta have fun, without the presence I'm hurt\nI'm ready for work, and I'm tryin, we can all change the world\nHere's what I pray, here's the garden, we need some special attention\nAnd not to mention we can party with the best of 'em, best of 'em\nRest of 'em beautiful too, please {?} do\nYoung Islamic brother, you with Christ, the world is cool\nDo what, ever the Lord tells you, and the reward is good\nEven if you have to live back in the hood, and shake your wood\nSee Bone Thugs-N-Harmony LiveGet tickets as low as $64You might also like[Hook]\n\n[Bizzy Bone]\nI'm walkin with the only begotten, never forgotten\nShed tears for mistakes that I've made, so dirty rotten\nI'm not a king, never was, I'm just a slave and a servant\nI love the light and I shall pass, angels, closed curtains\nNew king, tribe of Benjamin, help me succeed\nI'm star rockin Abraham, somebody please take the lead\nSo wherever Jesus go, I follow because I love him\nOn the right hand of granddad and none is above him\nAll the brothers in the temple teach me right in the struggle\nI can't imagine not existin at least, for a couple\nIt's trouble in these muddy waters, everyone know\nProbably the stitches certain levels, love yourself and now grow\nI see impatient truly help you make you rich and successful\nSo many people need a spirit, and this world is a cesspool\nTest you, bless you, love you, address you\nHuh, ain't no adultery, hey\n\n[Hook]Embed"

From this day forth, God willin\nLean back chillin, precious medal of steel, titanium\nNine percent of the cranium, baby you feel me?\nNo adultery-dultery, when I see-ee, I see-ee, we kill 'em\nStays dry for me daddy, baby sunset\nCome get a taste of what you never had, you ain't cum yet?\nWhen we raise up the one, yes, poppa he got you\nStandin right beside you in the midst of the storm\nBaby I ride with you, never die, not in spirit\nIt can't get much fuckin clearer, did you hear it? Yes!\n\n[Chorus]Embed"
