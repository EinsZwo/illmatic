Kerpow.. (kerpow.. kerpow..) OOOOH\nThen I blend into the crowd\n(Oh-ah, oh-ah, oh-ah, oh-ahh...) OOOOH\nHang with a bunch of hotheads, super hyphy and wild\nTell yo' batch to stop askin about a player\nInquirin about a player, can't fuck her right now later\nI'm busy gettin my paper and ridin 'round in my scraper\nInteractin networkin and campaignin like Arnold Schwarzenegger\nLike McCormick's I'm seasoned, I run my region (run yo' region)\nY'all think I'm starvin? Hell naw nigga I'm eatin (we eatin)\nStay barkin like Dino, lyin and cheatin\nKeep jackin my lingo one of these rappers gon' end up leakin\n\n[Hook 2X: E-40]\nYAY ARE-AHHHHH!!!

    "lyrics": "Happy to Be Here Lyrics[Intro: E-40]\nHard times, the struggle\nThe ups and downs, the highs and the lows\nYou know just goin through it man, ghetto politics\nTryin to make a way out of no way\nI was the oldest, so I had to be, the daddy of the family\nMomma had to work three jobs, oooh\nFeet stickin through my shoes, skid marks in my drawers\nGarage sales and flea markets, we never shopped at malls\nNo dental plan, no medikit - we poor like rain\nColored folks think that castor oil cures everythang\nPork chops and chicken, we like our food fried\nHypertension, Prinivil pills and hydro-chlorizide\nSome of my family still living, some of my folks done died\nHealth complications, natural causes and homicide\nJust tryin to survive, nothin to lose but plenty to gain\nStarted hustlin, flea flickin and servin that candy cane\nPut all my cars in my lady name, as a true hustler should\nShe had a 9 to 5, worked at Planned Parenthood\nWhile I was in the hood, up to no good\nWith a hoodie over my head, tryin to outslick the feds\nOr should I say cops, at this point in time I only had rocks\nWent from a little jelly jar up to a soup pot\nThe fast quarter my negro, don't want the slow nickel\nI done seen yola the same color as peanut brittle\nI done seen hella people relapse\nI done seen my homey grandparents go back to crack\nHow sick is dat? Beggin my loved ones to send some pictures\nPray for me over the phone and read me some scriptures\nOooh; it's gloomy out here, dark days ahead\nGod got my back but the devil he want my head\n[Chorus: D.D. Artis]\nI'm just happy to be here right now\nLot of my folks been locked up or laid down\nSee I ain't sayin I ain't shed no tears, no\nBut I'm just happy to be here\n\n[Verse: E-40]\nListen to this, oooooh\nThe devil-me side know that some of y'all done seen it\nSomebody's momma washin her son or her daughter's bloodstain off the cement\nWrong place at the wrong time, infiltrators drop a dime\nMistaken identity, bullets start flyin\nIn every direction, hit a pregnant teen, she passed\nBut her baby live through a C-section\nI know it sound foul and sound hecka rude, it ain't cool\nBut it go down like that sometime when you're funkin, and you're puttin down a move\nWe heartless and shrewd in this day and age, it ain't the same\nOur parents need to beat us with a belt, like Poody Tang\nI be high like an airplane\nI be smokin and perkin, takin out anger and stress on the wrong person\nRe-uppin and coppin turf an' then servin the soil block\nGrittin tryin to put some gifts in my kid's Christmas stock'\nOoooh - pour out some liquor and shed a tear\nFor the homies that never made it and family that ain't here\n\n[Chorus: D.D. Artis]\nI'm just happy to be here right now\nLot of my folks been locked up or laid down\nSee I ain't sayin I ain't shed no tears, no\nBut I'm just happy to be here\nYou might also like[Outro: D.D. Artis]\nSo happy\n(You know I'm happy to be here), you know I'm happy to be\n(Said I'm so happy to be here yeah) said I'm happy, so happy just to be here\n(To beeeeeee), to beeeeeee\n(To beeeeeee), to beeeeeee\n(To beeeeeee), to beeeeeee (I'm so happy)\n(Oh I'm so happy)\nI'm so happy to be, (to beeeeeeee-heeeeeeeeee)\nTo beeeeeeee-heeeeeeeeee (to be here)Embed"
