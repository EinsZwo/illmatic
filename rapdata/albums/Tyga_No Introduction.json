Cause bein the only child\nCould leave you feelin desperate, in need of attention\nEvery second, but since you man of the house you never get it\nPops left without a smile but you never miss him\nBut when you reminiscin, you wished you had a father figure\nAt least weekends, man pay a visit\nAwww forget it~! what about Lil' Jason up in prison?\nYou think an eight-year-old had bad intentions? (I don't know)\nPullin the trigger, on dad just barely killed him\nJust wanted to protect moms from the brutal hittings\nBut he a kid so it's their word against his\nMoms won't even testify scared of husband\nSo he in for some years, don't even know he did it\nBut can't regret it now, cause it's too late\n[Hook: Patrick Stump] + (Tyga)\nWe come to life when first class takes flight\nOnly sing the lines that make you press rewind\nEven dealing with electric, I think that he regrets it now\nHeart in light, dying love, everything looks better from above\nYou say it's getting old but I call it vintage love now, now\nDon't regret it now\n(At a human's price, tryin to live that life)\n(Can't slow down) Don't regret it now\n(Uh-uh determined by that dice, you only roll twice)\n(You broke now) Don't regret it now\n\n[Tyga]\nLet's say you and your homey, best friends one and only\nConfidant, who I trust, never phony\nJust I and the young guy I called my brodie\nWe was like age of 5 since he known me\nBut now it's like hazy skies and the mornings\nWaking up police say he died hollows pointed\nDamn I can't believe you God, why you want him?\nI needed him more than you, now what, you lonely?\nJust two more months man, we was good money\nNow he can't go to awards and meet stars\nI'm all alone now ridin in luxury cars\nLife like a movie now someone press fast forward\nSo I can chill with him again and feel real\nI'd rather have him here than this rap deal\nBut he can't regret it now, walkin into that crowd\nHad his jewelry on - next thing, man down\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[Patrick Stump]\nWork twice as hard to get half as far\nLove has legs, feet don't fail me now\nBrand new boy, brand new year\nCurtains open, I am a grand finale\nDid you get my voice mail? Sorry I'm out\nHaving the time of my life\nAnd, I'm gonna do whatever you'd do\nIf you could be me for one night\n\n[Tyga]\nIf you could be me for one night (night)\nCould you live you're life under lights? (Lights)\nLaminates, cameras, ice (ice)\nFour A.M. morning flights (flights)\nUh I don't think you can handle that pal\nI don't think you can handle this crowd\nIt's t-too late, can't regret it now\nIt's t-too late, can't regret it now\n\n[Patrick Stump]\nWe come to life when first class takes flight\nOnly sing the lines that make you press rewind\nEven dealing with electric, I think that he regrets it now\nHeart in light, dying love, everything looks better from above\nYou say it's getting old but I call it vintage love now\nNow\n[Hook]Embed"

I hope you heard the whole song\nIt was from me to you, somethin special\nHeh~! I'm lovin this music\nBut I wish you was here with me\nTo love it too... {*fades out*}Embed"

Wakin up to the cold wind\nSometimes, I wish I was a kid again\nSometimes, I don't even wanna remember it\nCause one time I remembered what I couldn't forget\nDamn! My stepdad beatin me again\nFor a bad grade, he must of had A's\nThe way he was hurtin me in a bad way\nMy mom hearin the scream but just turned away\nWhat the fuck, are you people crazy?\nI was only a baby, five months when they gave me\nTo my grandma, who was racist\nBut I ain't give a fuck, I just faced it\nLike mace to the police, I was danger\nFeelin like I'm in a manger\nBaby Jesus, save me from the anger\nShe's tryin to get me, into this closet I vanished quickly\nFuck that, I took 50\nFrom her purse bag, told her \"Don't miss me\"\nI ain't comin back, catch me on another path\nI need a bubble bath\nSomeone, take me in the plastic basket\nSittin on bubble wrap, I'm abandoned\nI need a new home, that isn't damaged\nA family whom care, to be parents\nErrant, my life on the mic\nMight wasn't raised too right, so I\nHad to decide to turn on the light\nDo somethin right, before I'm layin with the mice\nRotten alone on my neighbor's stolen bike\nTryin to think what my afterlife, gon' look like\nIt gotta look right... it gotta look right...\n[Chorus]\nBack to my bad life\nAnother day in the fast life got me feelin like I'm on the crack pipe\nNo lie, just the thought\nOf me gettin that type of high, but I'm in the dark\nWhere the shadows, follow, your every walk\nAnd as I move, I'm feelin like a shopping cart\nGimme this, gimme that son\nWhat'chu mean - ain't you supposed to be my mom?\nWhy don't you ask God, I worked hard for these two dimes\nI care what it's worth - just the fact that it's mine\nCheck your purse, don't you got\nMy life savings that you've been savin from birth?\nOh - I forgot you spent that\nOn your own gift wrap - I ain't get shit last Christmas\nBut a hug and a family wishlist for next year and shit\nHuh! 'Round next year and shit\nI'm gonna be on shit you can't even pronounce, in English\nI got anger\nThat's why I paint these songs, visually painting\nIt's awful ain't it? A little (Pinky) in (The Brain)\nBut hopefully, time is the pain\nCause as of now, I just wanna run away... run away...\n\n[Chorus]You might also likeEmbed"
