Not a damn thing\nGot a problem, nigga? Shoot me in the streets, dog\nI'm a one-man game\nDon't take this lightly, if I want you dead, you gone\nI can make that happen because, nigga, my bread is long\nI done been on both sides of the track\nYou can say I changed the game\nA lot of niggas try to get in my lane\nEverybody askin' me the same whole thing, what he say?\n[Hook]\nOh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)\nOh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)\nOh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)\nOh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)\nOh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)\nOh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)\nOh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)\nOh Timbaland, where he gon' run to?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI ain't goin' nowhere, dog, I'mma be right here in your face\nCan't do it like me, dog, your kick drum ain't got enough bass\nDon't ever talk bad about me, you just might make me mad\nAnd I just might see you somewhere and break your ass in half\nThis not a Timbaland that you used to\nNow I'm in a whole 'nother zone\nYou could let me do me, you could do you\nOr get popped in your dome\nHit love for the birds to the block, so recognize the game\nTimbaland ain't gotta run nowhere, baby\nTimbaland got private planes\n\n[Hook]\nOh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)\nOh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)\nOh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)\nOh Timbaland, where he gon' run to? (Nowhere)\nOh Timbaland, where he gon' run to?
