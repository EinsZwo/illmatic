    "lyrics": "Hold It Down Lyrics[Produced by 9th Wonder]\n\n[Verse 1: Buckshot]\nTime flies by\nThere's so many people trying to make it in the world, so am I\nI can't lie, I be on the side like beer\nAnything move and I'm there\nSoon as I hear money calling I pick up a cell, cautious\nCause my little man in the cell\nI can't even tell, what's the set-up, But\nSometimes I don't care I'm dead-up\nAs soon as I get up I'm prepared\nTo lockdown the town like I'm the mayor\nYou know, stocks and shares, not this year\nLaid back in the cut, No, not this year\nIt's a all out brawl out, fall out the line\nIn my Boot Camp it's a thin line\nWho the truth, who lying, who the cat, who lying\nWho cock back, who firing? Who the raw, who the cook?\nWho shake, who shook? Criminal mind from a crook\nA page from a book, motivation from a push, look\nIt's hard enough being a black man or a brown man\nRight now we held down man\nAnd you can tell we in Hell now man\nLet's get to Heaven because we Hellbound man\nLet's hold it down man...\n[Hook: Tyler Woods]\nAnd you know we got to hold it down\nI'mma put it on the line\nCause it's my life\nAnd you know\nAnd you know\nAnd you know\n\n[Verse 2: Talib Kweli]\nListening to Donnie Hatha-Way up in his last days\nWhy he have to pass away so young\nWhile his craft was being mastered\nI don't want to ask a question with no answer\nBut I still fight for the chance to write the cure for cancer\nWipe poverty of the map with a verse and a 9th Wonder track\nAm I right? Holla back or is it too ambitious\nThese dudes too weak or am I too damn vicious\nWhen their hair waves like a magic wand I excite fans\nThe way I raise my son give you a nice tan\nMake him into a man is the rival that's been planned\nBible in the bullets aside of the night stand\nYou still in the right hand to give justice to a lamb\nStill in the wrong hand the shit hit the fan\nBlaming the white man, like damn\nObstacles popping up like spam\nWhoa, I rap from the view of the black and the brown man\nBar code on the soul so the music can sound scan\nBar code on the soul so the music can sound scan\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3: Buckshot]\nI know time's too slow for you\nYou're acting like you Ready for the World like the group\nDon't do something you might regret\nYeah it's cool that you jog but you like to sweat\nOn the corner, on your Nike sweats\nI'll bet, cops come, I jet, you stay\nCause you still ain't learned but you will today\nYou going to see how it feels today\nTo wait for somebody to feed you a meal but hey\nShorty parlez, ain't no rush take your time\nI'm at a whole new level with mine\nTo go further I'd murder the rhyme\nAnd get busy when I'm serving you lines like, this\nIt's hard enough being a black man or a brown man\nRight now we held down man\nAnd you can tell we in hell now man\nLet's get to heaven because we hell bound man\nLet's hold it down man\n\n[Hook]Embed"

Heyyy!\n(x2)\n\n[Verse 1]\nBut not so fast\nSo you can follow me on the blocks I pass\nYou don't need a car, you can hop out that cab\nSo we can take a walk, yeah, it's far, but back to my lab\n(Heyyy!) You don't need to Benz or drop\nWhen we exercise your body, your mind a few blocks\nDecide not, or decide if you will\nCause in a couple of seconds I'mma style up the hill\nFor real, what's the deal? What's your answer?\nYou ain't gotta roll in the Lambo-\n-Ghini, believe me, it's all good, you can walk with me\nTwo-step, Three-step, even four with me\nMa, ain't no need for parking, boo\nLet's hit the park, walk, and spark it boo\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nLook, I know he wanna impress you, in the SU-V\nGuess who messed with thee, me\nWe could hit the train, split the fee\nIt's the shit to me, he forget to be, so you're sick of thee\nWay he be actin', cause he got that kitted up Magnum\nLike he live in a mansion, and that Phantom\nYeah, he might take you dancin', but\nWalkin' with me is guaranteed romancin'\nI spark the lie when your eyes enhance and\nYou recognize how your mind's in a trance and\nWalk with me, then talk with me\nNiggas be on, pullin they whips on when they off they B\nTo the side, like \"Nah, come check me!\"\nLater but Buck'll walk you around for a favor\nMa... (Now here we go, now here we go, heyyy!)\nNow his behavior\nIs what you hate cause\nHe really think you stressin cause he got that new Lexus;\nSay just, call me when you wanna chill\nAnd I'll be down to take a walk around the hill\nBuck's life...\n\n[Hook]\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nListen, we can ride any time we choose\nTonight, the Beemer's parked, we ridin the shoes\nYup, I'll put your mind in the mood\nYou'll take a walk with me down the avenues\nI ain't even have to do\nHalf of the things he tried to gas you, boo\nLike ride by a view, unnatural\nWith the system on blast, he about to crash\nAt last, you ain't got a run and jog\nBut if you're bored you can check my new joint on your iPod\nOr we could take it back to the Walkman\nPop in a CD and listen to B.D. often\nI love it when I see you in the morning\nCause we can hold hands and hit the block touring\n\n[Hook]Embed"
