Dot beat (hit me baby)\nSometimes I get drunk, for stress relief\nOther times I put \"Life After Death\" on and peep\nWe ride (we ride) what's a four door Bentley Coupe\nWithout my nigga on the passenger side?\nAnd still I try (I try) to get money stay fly\nFinish the race, holdin my crown high (take that)\nI fly next to God, my eyes on the prize\nBeen away a long time but now I'm reenergized\n(AS WE PROCEED) The life and times of a mastermind (c'mon)\nDedicate every breath to claim my designs (it's mine)\nAnd the day I die, let a G4 fly\nAnd dump my ashes over N.Y\nYou might also like[Chorus]\n\n[Diddy - over Chorus]\nY'all know my name, y'all know my motherfuckin name\nI told you I was gon' be great ma\nI TOLD YOU I WAS GON' BE SOMEBODY!\nOhhh!!

I need y'all to sing children\nSing, I like it when the children sing\nI like it when you sing; I like it when they sing man\nThat lets you know something's comin\nOh it's comin - aww man something's comin\nI like this sound of this - something's comin\nYou can picture like a photograph, envision the image\nOf one-two-fifth street and Lenox\nThe old folks their souls are cold like tenants\nTryin to keep your weight up better eat that spinach\nFor four twenty-five niggas lives get diminished\nThe world serious, I'm tryin to win a pennant\nCops be on patrol through the block every minute\nItchin just to pop somethin, swearin I'm a menace\nThey disturb me but it's love like tennis\nMan, cap to the side and my jersey is vintage\nChicks'll make a nigga dick hard like a Guinness\nDamn it's a scam but I handle my business\nPlan to be the man if the Lord be my witness\nDo my chin-ups\u200b with the walk sign for my physical fitness\n16's sicker than Alzheimer's, flows is ridiculous\nHold up\n\n[Hook: children sing]\nTold y'all really really y'all can't hold up\nTold y'all really really y'all can't hold up\nTold y'all really really y'all can't hold up\nHold up, hold up hold up hold up hold up\n\n[Diddy]\nEasy now I'm seein 'em, mind where you patrol\nFall back young'un, play your lane like a goal\nWhen his majesty speaks, speech defy gravity\nBluetooth nigga but I don't have any cavities\nDiddy got it wrapped like cocoons\nPop shit like needles through cow manure balloons\nI urge you to tell a friend, warn a brother\nAbout my splurges, merges with Warner Brothers\nThugs actin funny cause chicks call me honey\nSee a 9 figure nigga makin Bugs Bunny money\nEons beyond bling bling\nSo I chose to get engaged to these sweet 16's\nMake a name, let it bang so beautiful\nThe theme music for crews that move pharmaceuticals\nOr, suitable for, a recuitable whore\nTo service the whole crew when we out on tour\nHold up, hold up, hold up, hold up\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[Diddy]\nIt's like the music will literally stop time\n(Hold up hold up hold up)\nWe roll up, 20 deep, cock D swoll up\nGet inflicted by my verbal conviction\nA Bad Boy but far from a Detroit Piston\nYou're not focused enough, you're not listenin\nYou need to slow down, hold up like kickstand\nHop to it, get on your grind music\nAcross 110th sharp caesar with a lime music\nFine-tuned with the proper soul seasoning\nYour live shows are boring you're just not pleasin 'em\nStop teasin 'em you can't rock Palladium\nWe bring New York back like that West side stadium\nFuck the game and if the fame went away\nStill be the hardest workin man in entertainment today\nLearn a lesson in that, no questionin that\nNo guesswork involved so stop stressin the facts\nHold up\n\n[Hook]Embed"

Brandy]\nHow can you turn on me?\n(How can you how can you)\nHow can you purposely?\n(How can you how can you)\n\n[Hook - Brandy]\nLessoned learned house can burn\nWere close to heat\nBet your words don't mean nothing to me\nThought you said\nThought you said that you loved me\nThought you said\nThought you said that you need me\nThought you said\nThought you said you complete me\nThought you said you were never gonna let it go\n\nThought you said\nThought you said when you held me\nThought you said\nThought you said when'd you tell me\nThought you said no one else could replace me\nThought you said that your never gonna let it go\n\n[Verse II - Diddy]\nThe times that you weren't there\nThe times that you left me here\nThe times that I needed you\nYou know my love is true\nMy passions inside for you\nThe nights that I cried for you\nA man has these feelings too\nSame shit that shall go thru'\nI been here before\nSometimes the pain you ignore\nUntil it's right at your door\nAnd then you just can't take it no more\nWhy does love feel this way?\nWhy does it hurt so bad\nYou might also like[Hook - Brandy]\nHow can you turn on me?\n(How can you how can you)\nHow can you purposely?\n(How can you how can you)\n\n[Hook - Brandy]\nLessoned learned house can burn\nWere close to heat\nBet your words don't mean nothing to me\nThought you said\nThought you said that you loved me\nThought you said\nThought you said that you need me\nThought you said\nThought you said you complete me\nThought you said you were never gonna let it go\n\nThought you said\nThought you said when you held me\nThought you said\nThought you said when'd you tell me\nThought you said no one else could replace me\nThought you said that your never gonna let it go\n\n[Verse 3 - Diddy]\nThe heartache and pain\nSometimes it goes to your brain\nSometimes it makes you insane\nSometimes our joy is our pain\nCuz it tears you apart\nThese affairs of the heart\nI think I'm strong but I'm not\nAnd when I look in ya eyes\nYou know it kills me inside\nBut I can't wait for that day\nThat you come back to me girl\nAfter we both go away\nIt's just to see if it's real\nThere's no denying the fact\nIt's meant to be if you let it go\nAnd then they come back\nIf this is our last dance we need to practice our steps\nThe situation I left behind but your hearts what I kept\nYou said I did you wrong you did me wrong we was both at fault\nAnd of course you lost me with your alibis\nAnd all of your talking\nAnd most important I just question my self\n[Bridge - Brandy]\nThe pain is taking over I just can't believe\n(I need your hand)\nWhat happened then compared to now is dreams\n(I need your hand)\nAnd I know now that you'll need me\n\n[Diddy:]\nI can't sleep, I can't breathe\nI ain't eat in days\nStomach pains from arguing\nDidn't you cheat on me that's how the problems started\nAnd as far as I'm concerned we learned our lesson\nWell it's all in the healing and that process has got me stressin'\nI'm so pressured I'm so physically drained\nI ain't thinkin straight\nI loved you more than my own self\nAlthough I couldn't bear the pain of seein my old self\nYoung wild uncontroled self\nI love you girl\nI don't need no one else\n\n[Hook - Brandy]\nLessoned learned house can burn\nWere close to heat\nBet your words don't mean nothing to me\nThought you said\nThought you said that you loved me\nThought you said\nThought you said that you need me\nThought you said\nThought you said you complete me\nThought you said you were never gonna let it go\n\nThought you said\nThought you said when you held me\nThought you said\nThought you said when'd you tell me\nThought you said no one else could replace me\nThought you said that your never gonna let it go\n\n[Outro - Diddy & Brandy]\n\n[Diddy]\nWhen I look in your eyes\nYou know it kills me inside\n\n[Brandy]\nDidn't you. didn't you...ooohhh\n\n[Brandy]\nLesson learned\nHouse can burn\nWe close to heat\nBet your words don't mean nothing to me\n\n[Diddy]\nThese affairs of the heart\nI think I'm strong but I'm not\n\n[Brandy]\nThought you said thought you said that you love me\nThought you said thought you said that you need me\n\n[Diddy]\nCome back to me girl\n\n[Brandy]\nHow can you how can you\nThought you said thought you said you complete me\nThought you said you were never gonna let it goEmbed"
