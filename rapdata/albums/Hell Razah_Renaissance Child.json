Razah Rubies...\nLet's go, tell 'em\n\n[Hell Razah]\nI was born in the era of kings, of heroin dreams\nNow it be a Maccabees, spreading my wings (spread 'em)\nI ain't trippin' off material bling\nI analyze off of Billie Holiday to Queen\nWhat was Marvin Gaye thinking when he wrote that theme\nA Trouble Man, why his pops had a gun his hand, damn\nHip hop go to way back then\nDaddy used to sing doo-wop with two of his friends\nI seen an oo-wop when I was like ten, excited by sin\nI got my first gold front from Ben\nEighty-nine, I was into Rakim, for dropping gems\nMost niggas learned a lot from him\nGrandma used to cook with sounds of Sam Cooke\nMid-60's, my moms then moved to Red Hook\nSame hood Al Capone was put, and got his rep as a crook\nIn them criminal books, we don't look\nWhen crack hit I could never forget\nIn '92 Mr. Daly was hit by gun clips\nYou had to pump if you wanted some kicks\nThe best product on the block, it was quicker to flip\nWe had whips, but it wasn't legit\nI reminisce, Calvin Klein, he was running the shit\n'76 came a heavenly prince, with one gift\nTo uplift, by the name Chron Smith\n[Interlude: Hell Razah]\nDedicated to Miss Caroline Smith\nSpecial love and respect\nTo real true pioneers (yeah), people like Ray Charles (we in here)\nBarry White, let's get back into the hall of fame, come on\n\n[Talib Kweli]\nYo, yo, it's like we all just beads on a string\nSon is blind like a boxer that bleed in the ring\nFrom a cut opened up above his right eye\nBody all black and blue, like the Brooklyn night sky, uh\nBobbing and weaving, and dodging the propaganda\nMy raps take it back like shopping at Alexander's\nMy momma had the fly afro, my father cooked for a week and leftovers with casserole\nWe didn't have much, but with a little bit of love\nMade due with the little bit we had, yo\nWe in a new millennium, Granny still sing hymn slow\nJim Crows still keep the blacks po'\nLook we blessed with the power to move people with music\nIt's the natural resources, and we use it to broadcast and transmit live from hell\nWhat don't kill you, make you stronger, I'm alive to tell\n\n[Interlude: Hell Razah]\nHurry up, hurry up, hurry up, man\nYo, yo, make sure you write it on the wall\nMake sure it say, Renaissance Child\nTalib Kweli, MF DOOM, written for the babies\nLet's go\nYou might also like[MF DOOM]\nVik slick talk, with a cough full of North\nOf course New York floss, don't know blue pork\nBefore you walk across, look both ways\nThe third and the fourth of them nowaday ofays\nKept a dog on a wooden leg\nAnd hustled all night in the fog on the reg\nEven dressed like a bum and could beg\nInstead did the other on the strength, what a good egg\nBeen bred to win, since head spins, ooh them gems\nSpread too thin, depends on who's losin\nHeads do spin, it's deaded, now who's in?\nThe gang's all here, enough combined slang to bang all year\nIt's on, like it ain't never been on cordless before\nReport for lawless, bosses off shore\nWith horses, hay and tablets, made em with rabbits\nHabits til they hate 'em and had it, damn it\nAnd he's gone with the wind\nDead wrong, a song with a spin and a grin\nOut of style, with the blow out the mild mannered smile\nLike a foul wild Spaniard on the show out\nVaughn, the one you trick-a-don\nWhy stick it, if you gotta slip a slicker on, Viktor Vaughn\n\n[Outro: Hell Razah]\nYeah, to all the Cadillac riders, and it's on\nAs it was in the beginning, so shall it be in the end\nAll the fathers with the godfathers, hip hop lives forever and ever\nAnd ever... this is something you gon' be able to pass down to your babies\nFrom generation to generation, that's right, aight?\nOne love... and we out of here1Embed"

When they done raped daughters\nAnd manslaughtered the father figure with strong liquor\nMeanwhile the angel of death became my baby sitter\nIt's like I'm Nat Turner going through a Bible Scripture\nThey took our black Jesus and gave us Cesare's picture\nIf cops shoot at niggas, that make us all sinners\nSo when I grab my AK, I pray the Lord forgive us\nWe in the hood, akh with Enoch walking with us\nJust pyramid builders, but they don' made us killers\nMurdered Pablo and framed us as drug dealers\nTook Colombia's cocaine with no shame\nAnd had Charlie Parker hitting his dope vein\nAnd then it backfired to Kurt Cobain\nYou do the crime, do the time, you invented the game\nI got no I.D., I switched up my government name\nAll of my thugs love to bang, we be one in the same\nI got my sons coming up, so I wanted to change\nWe gotta change somewhere man\nYou might also like[Sample]\n\"All over this country, they cried\nMen and women.. fathers and mothers\nCried for those who disappeared\"\n\n[Hook 2X: Hell Razah]\nWe got to air it out, cock and squeeze, give me some room to breath\nWe be those Huey P's, watching over little seeds\nAir it out, cock and squeeze, vowels to meet the kings\nWe be those Maccabeez, throwing up angel wings\n\n[Outro: Hell Razah]\nRed Hook, it's Razah Rubies\nThe Renaissance Child, Brooklyn\nI'm airing it out, from here on\nYouknowhatimasaying, we gon' continue on\nThe album don't stop here, knowhatimsaying?\nGhetto Government, this is just what it is, man\nThis is life, in it's purest form\nAmbassador, hip hop in it's purest form\nThat's my nigga right there.. it's been reborn\nThe rebirth, the Renaissance Child\nKnowhatimsaying? We Da Last Future\nI'mma air it out, anytime you see me\nAnywhere, any TV, any magazine, word up, man\nAnywhere, anything you see me do, Maccabeez\nYou gon' know why I Hell Raze\nYou gon' know why they call me Hell Razah, aight?\nBig up to Tribe of JudahEmbed"
