(innnn the trunk)\n\n[Verse 1]\nI heard somebody say that the South ain't got no lyricists\n'Bang bang' at the game like everyone down here is pissed\nYou lookin for the truth then look no further, here it is\nTurn it up a notch so they can not say they not hearin this\nThey say Chamill is sick, click click, here's a clip\n'Bang bang' at the rap game to make your spirits lift\nAnd it seems to me the industry is all on Jigga's dick\nWho? You, you, you, and you nigga - pick a click\nUniversal sent me to bring some realness to the industry\nGot here, then I realized that ain't nobody real but me\nOkay, a couple niggas but none of 'em real as me\nTell your favourite rapper he should diss me if he disagree\nMy bad I'm acting like your favourite rapper isn't me?\nTell your second favorite who's the best and show 'em a picture of me\nHe'd have to take me out to prove that he's as sick as me\nSo me versus me, the only battle that y'all gonna get to see\nI'm plainly sayin what I'm sayin to make these haters mad\nPerpetratin hatin ass, see me ridin candy slab\nDisbelieve his ass, how many vehicles can he have?\nI be losin count myself and I ain't even that bad at math\nThat's how we do it in Texas, poppin trunk and grippin wood\nWe reply to threats (how?) Nigga, I wish you would\nYou can keep on talking, but that's only if you could\nGotta turn my speakers up, can you hear 'em now?

That's what;s up\nMoney stack it up when they feel they have enough\nGet the chips and add 'em up, then she givin that to us\nDon't put all that in cuffs, treat your money like a slut\nNiggas better share, hell yeah, cause I just wanna cut\nA hater gettin cut, someone gon' get hurt (hurt)\nEspecially if you met me and was disrespect turf (turf)\n(Houston, Texas) I'm the worst, ice looking like sherbert\nBouncin' off my chest, you're starin' at it like a pervert\nMixtape god, don't hate me, go to church first (why?)\nMight as well since all the rappers wearin church shirts\nBetter think ahead of time, call yourself a nurse (nurse!)\nDiss me in your second and you won't get to finish your third verse\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nYou in the presence of the finest\nThe game is full of fakers, all these rapping niggas frontin' (frontin')\nControversy Sells, the industry giving 'em what they want (want)\nSee he ain't gangsta as he say, that's why they dress 'em up\nGet a vest, a plastic gun and go pull a publicity stunt\nHo act like she slow, don't know that I'm rich\nAnd ignore the handles missing from the do's of my whip\nBut then she saw me on TV and told me pause for a flick\n(What you tell her?) You can \"106 & Park\" on my dick (on my dick)\nCan't speak about Texas and not mention me\nCause the world gon' have to see the truth come out eventually\nI'll rip any gimmick rapper out from A to Z\n934-829 to the 2 if you still disagree\nWe never marry a ho, what I'mma marry you fo'\nI'm too busy tearin my shows up and getting married to dough (dough)\nGrave dig a nigga, (Whatchu mean?)

trill niggas\nEastside, Westside, chunk ya deuce up\n\n[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]\nPlenty niggas get they head turned red for the bread\nStart off with the information, load it up in ya head\nCouldn't hold it, so it turned out its sumthin' he said\nWhat he tell the FEDS (need someone to call)\nYour decision was to snitchin' and they was there to listen\nWhen he told what he know, said they barely was trippin'\nLess time, now the niggas in a better position\nUnless you count the fact that the streets know he was snitchin'\nHe was lookin at a 30 but he only did 10\nHow them years turn to months, can he tell you dat, and\nHe ain't really gotta answer, just the sweat in his hands\nWill he make it out to make it, hmmm well it depends\nEverybody know the info you was tellin ya friends\nPlus the streets know the deals that you made with the pen\nRussian Roulette, yep nigga bet the barrel will spin\nYou hear that, yea nigga thats the sound of revenge\n\n[Hook 2: Chamillionaire]\nWalk down the right road\n'Cause the streets is so cold\nYou betta take ya life slow\nOr you'll miss it\nListen to the G-Code\nIf you know what I know\nThen you'll keep yo mouth closed\n(Keep your mouth closed, nigga)\nWe don't tolerate snitches\nYou might also like[Hook 1: Bun B]\nThis is for my gangstas, real niggas, ballas, trill niggas\nNorthside, Southside, chunk ya deuce up\nThis is for my gangstas, real niggas, ballas, trill niggas\nEastside, Westside, chunk ya deuce up\n\n[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]\nIf you gon live that crime life, I hope you hold dat 9 tight\nYou live life like a pussy then thats probably what you'll die like\nI neva eva loved a sucka, them ain't really my type\nRats, snakes, yea mayne the game is full of wildlife\nDon't wanna do no time right?\nYou wanna live that high life\nLike go withdrawl, have a hundred thousand in ya eye sight\nEnter ya crib, see the clouds peepin' through ya skylight\nYou be a copycat, caught him right after my life, cause mine right\nThats what he told me but I didn't listen\nDoin crime for a dime wasn't my intention\nYou insane, think his name sumthin' I will mention\nOnly snitches (need someone to tell)\nAlotta niggas in the game, hustlin' doin they thing\nUsin codes on the phone with unusual slang\nIf you know what he know then you won't say a thing\nYou wouldn't need someone to tell\nCareful bout the life you lead, ain't smart with ya life\nYou plead, the streets will ignite ya T\nLike you ain't got the right to breathe\n(Cough) To choke on the realness\nReality is what the fake don't know how to deal with\nWords leak from the teeth, but he'll say seal it\nThen go get a undercover brother he can chill with\nFind a nigga that be hustlin to make a deal with\nBut the streets will hold court for him and'll deal with it\n[Hook 2: Chamillionaire]\nWalk down the right road\n'Cause the streets is so cold\nYou betta take ya life slow\nOr you'll miss it\nListen to the G-Code\nIf you know what I know\nThen you'll keep

up\nThis is for my gangstas, real niggas, ballas, trill niggas\nEastside, Westside, chunk ya deuce up\n\n[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]\nThis for the G's, street jugglin, movin the fire\nWhen you talkin' what you talkin' it ain't through the wire\nPolice pull you over, now they callin' you a liar\nYou got amnesia, don't even know the dude beside ya\nYou don't know, you ain't sayin, you ain't heard what he said\nTold you a closed mouth ain't gon neva get fed\nA open mouth'll get you county instead of the FEDS\nSome scared niggas speak up so they'll be less in the red\nNiggas can't deal with no 9 to 5 so they day-to-day budgeters\nIts the hustlers that get put away by the customers\nYou upstate, niggas use to be southerners\nHere the streets make the laws and don't answer the governors\nWe the niggas thats too real to snitch on a snitch\nBut make a snitch turn to poof with a flick of the wrist\nThat ain't gon get in arguements, just go get you a clip\nAnd they gon think about the consequences, let 'em repent\n[Hook 2: Chamillionaire]\nWalk down the right road\n'Cause the streets is so cold\nYou betta take ya life slow\nOr you'll miss it\nListen to the G-Code\nIf you know what

got nuthin to say\nWhen they come question you, just keep it 100\nAnd go ahead and chunk ya deuce upEmbed"

[Yeah]\nI tell the bartender same Hennessey on ice for me\nHer drink starts emptying while she's spillin' out her life to me [Slow down]\nTelling me about her goals and how successful she would like to be\nInvitin' me into a session of her life and she\nSeems so damn innocent but something isn't right to me\nShe pulls out her picture phone \"I got pics, would you like to see?\"\nI'm thinking she gotta be friendly as hell\nGiving her soul to me, it's like an identity sell\nWe never met is the story that my memory tells\nTelling me tales like she doesn't handle Hennessey well\nGetting into it, getting intimate and into details\nSee, I just met you and you showing me your kids\n\"Who said I had any kids? I didn't bring up no kids\"\nThen who's in this picture, \"Man, let me show you just who it is\"\nYou might also like[Hook: Natalie]\nI don't know who you are\nBut you seem very nice\nSo will you talk to me?\nShall I tell you a story?\nShall I tell you a dream?\nThey think I'm crazy\nThey don't know that I like it here\n\n[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]\nUmm, I don't remember her name but she look like an angel\nKnew she wasn't from here, I knew that she didn't hang a\nRound this part of the hood but hey the story gets stranger\nCause this stranger was stranger than I could explain you see\nShe said she wasn't married but the ring on her finger\nTold me that she was lyin' and just using the same uhh\nGame I use on women so I couldn't even blame her\nSpitting the game I spit to 'em when I'm trying to bang her\nI bump into this dime, he told me that he used to know you\nHe told me about the loyalty and the love he used to show you\nHe said what he said with a passion like it was so true\nWouldn't take advantage of the fact that the listeners really didn't know you\nThere's pictures in my pocketbook, almost got it, I'll show you\nShe digs in her purse and while she fumbles around\nTo find that photo, I'm like \"Oh no there's some trouble in town\"\nI turn around to see two officers coming in now\nThey walk in real suspicious and come and sit down\nSo close, I can see they barrels of the guns to the ground\nSo close that they can listen to either of us now\nWe turn back around and then she says no need for whispering\nThen she tells me \"I don't really give a damn whose listening\nTry to make it last a long time was my mission\nAnd he kept on tripping and then I got pissed at him\nHit 'em with my fist and them punches were never missing him\"\n[Hook: Natalie]\nI don't know who you are\nBut you seem very nice\nSo will you talk to me?\nShall I tell you a story?\nShall I tell you a dream?\nThey think I'm crazy\nThey don't know that I like it here\n\n[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]\nOkay, let's get this straight, your man cheated on you and now\nYou talking to a perfect stranger like it's making you proud\nAnd the rest of this conversation she just telling me how\nWasn't her boyfriend in the pic but a familiar smile\nShe said pictures can be deceiving like she knew he was foul\nLook closer, you'll see a coward who uses a smile as power\nFleeing the smoke strength, couldn't stand it another hour\nSo she did what she did then she went to go take a shower\nDamn what do you mean? I couldn't tell you that I'm missin him\nI don't understand what your saying, how did you get rid of him?\nShe dissing him, as I ask her what it is she did to him\nShe stops then I say ''Ay keep talkin I'm listening''\nI don't wanna tell about the images I'm picturing\nHenny spilling then she tell me For real and\nThat the feeling that I was feeling is that I wanted to kill him\nSomething's wrong here and I know just who is the villian\nHer voice was getting louder, the moral is getting clearer\nThe officers is looking at us and I can tell they can hear her\nTold me It was protection, Reached for it in the stash\nThe plastic is what she grabbed and she put it right on his ass\nBust it before the blast, she thought she was free at last\nBaby I think you crazy, I'm sorry I'm pressing for time\nI gotta go grind, time\u2019s been interesting\nNow I'm sweating and stressing, this girl's got me guessing\nThat this conversation is two types of evil confession\nShe pulls a clearer picture, It's my damn ex-best friend\nHow you know him? She told me that she was with him at his house\nWatching movies for Sundays when they be chilling\nAnd that's exactly the day that the hospital came to get him\nThe feeling was the worst feeling she possibly could be feeling\nStood up and then I yelled out \"Why the hell did you kill him?\"\nI didn't kill him, I have AIDS, she had sex with 'em and that's crazy!1Embed"

Or if I run, am I missing something?\nI took the time out to save a little bread\nNow my eyes got water in 'em\nWhy the fuck am I still standing here?\nNobody love me, I ain't happy here\nMy mama said she can't handle him\nBut still, I'm looking at the bright side\nBut I view it through my other eye, cause it's a different color sky\nThen the last one, my mind set on the prize that may never come\nSo do I try to stay alive, or do I grab a gun\nEnd it all, put a stop to the pain\nThat goes on in my head, everytime it rains\nThe devil's speaking, so you listening to the thoughts\nOf an evil spirited demonic person everytime I talk\nI'm confused, by my psychological set backs\nIn the storm, watching out through the wet cracks\nLooking for heaven, off in all the wrong places\nI've given up so why the long faces?\nLet it rain\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3 - Chamillionaire]\nYour bills keep adding up, to be alone you prefer\nBill collectors steady calling, starting to get on your nerves\nYour rent due on the first, but right now it's the third\nTelling yourself it's gon get better, but ain't believing a word\nFeel like it's hard to deal, tomorrow it's hard as steel\nNot to mention the realest member of your family is getting ill\nTell me it isn't so, tell me it isn't real\nIn the mist of all the drama, you take a lil' time to kneel\nTo deal you take a pill, just to deal with the drama\nYou thinking your life sinking, and there isn't a plumber\nThey tell you what doesn't kill you, only makes you stronger\nYou'd have to be a Superman, to lift as much as me partna\n(Could tell you stay strong) you're trying, but help is just what you doubting\nCause the room is a monsoon, that's never gon get to drying\nThe storm is moving on, and you thinking these people lying\nThey saying they had it worse, but how come they all keep on smiling\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Billy Cook]\nDon\u2019t let stress take control, gonna be alright I know\nI'ma make it through fa sho, fa sho yeah \u2014 2x\n[Hook]\n\n[Singing]\nMy memry, heeeey-heeey yeah\nStressing me-stressing me, my memories\nThat\u2019s what they telling me\nI\u2019m trying to focus on the road that\u2019s ahead of me\nBy my memories, yeah heeey yeeeah\n\n[Talking]\nWhen it seems like nothing but dark clouds\nAre raining in on your bright, sunny day\nRemember, the sunlight always comes after the rain\nYou should be thankful, everyday\nShould be a celebration, of life2Embed"

you peeping me take a picture\nYou peeping me take a picture, (you should take a photograph)\n\n[Bridge: Bun B]\nCatch me today, with a Canon or a Kodak\nCause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback\n(You see it's real, they be like look at that\nPicture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph)\n\n[Verse 1: Chamillionaire]\nIntroducing the truest voice of the South, it's who else but me fool\nDon't let all that foolishness they feed you, on T.V. mislead you\nDon't let all the magazines, and them papers out there deceive you\nThe cups that be used to sip, but Caucasian kinda like my tee do\nYou see that hand be glistening, you see the Sedans we flipping\nThe hundreds of grands we getting, these units of scans we shipping\nYou see that Caddy tipping, them thangs on that Caddy twisting\nThat paint and that candy dripping, that drank and that can is missing\nThat ain't a Cola, though dry and you feeling sober\nBoys trying to switch it over, apply it up in a soda\nHome of the Houston hustlers, who grinding and hit the quota\nWho fire and hit the doja, you high when you sniff the odor\nTold ya you gotta have, a foreign or buy your slab\nAfford it then buy it that's, important without it now\nYou ain't gotta take college class, to see that we bout our cash\nYou not if you gotta ask, let's take a pic by the slab hol' up\nYou might also like[Hook: Chamillionaire]\nYou see my slab, you see my candy slab\nPicture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph\nYou see my chick, you see my chick is bad\nPicture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph\nYou see it's real, they be like look at that\nPicture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph\nPhotograph, ph-ph-ph-photograph-photograph\nPicture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph\n\n[Verse 2: Chamillionaire]\nWhen I'm tipping they'll probably watch me, the cops'll be paparazzi\nAnd try to patrol my posse, we shining and glowing glossy\nThe jealous will try to top me, we keep it too real to copy\nWhat I'm listening to ain't a floppy, that disc gon be Screwed and Chop-pied\nAll the ballers will ride to this, deposit deposit slips\nBuy the car and apply the fifth, raise the trunk an entire lift\nUse to go to that Kappa, but Kappa ain't been as crunk\nSo I'm popping up at Daytona, on chrome and I'm popping trunk\nJamming that \"Ridin' Dirty\", while riding beside the laws\nAnd they staring over at me, trying to scare me like I'mma pause\nTell 'em naw they know I'mma crawl, all day in the robber cause\nI'm trying to go wash the ride, till them tires have whiter walls\nYou peeping him take a picture, that chrome and that paint official\nYou smoking then take a swisha, there's plenty just take 'em wit ya\nYou chilling you ain't a sipper, then I'mma be hanging wit ya\nTake a hold of the grain and grip a, handful and smile for the pictures nigga\n[Hook: Chamillionaire]\nYou see my slab, you see my candy slab\nPicture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph\nYou see my chick, you see my chick is bad\nPicture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph\nYou see it's real, they be like look at that\nPicture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph\nPhotograph, ph-ph-ph-photograph-photograph\nPicture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph\n\n[Verse 3: Bun B]\nYou see the bling up on my bracelet, and the shine on my chest\nSyrup in my styrofoam, it's sweet with doja no cess\nYou done put it down with the rest, time to roll with the best\nCause when you ride with the original, you ain't gotta guess\nI'm the connection that you need, when they say it's a drought\nCause it's not really a drought, them other niggas just out\nAnd I'm the plug you gotta have, when they say the river's dry\nCause it's not really dry, they just ran out of supply\nI'm too fly for the clouds, too down for the green grass\nBetter wear tinted lenses, if you look at my clean ass\nCatch me today, with a cannon or a Kodak\nCause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback\nCandy still dripping, 4's is still tipping\nWood grain grass, steering wheel I'm still gripping\nRepping for P.A.T., the West and the East\nAnd I'm repping for Pimp C, till he get back on the streets it never cease\n[Hook: Chamillionare]\nYou see my slab, you see my candy slab\nPicture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph\nYou see my chick, you see my chick is bad\nPicture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph\nYou see it's real, they be like look at that\nPicture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph\nPhotograph, ph-ph-ph-photograph-photograph\nPicture perfect nigga, you should take a photograph\n\n[Bridge: Chamillionaire & Bun B]\nMy life is real baby, ain't just a song (ain't just a song)\nGripping that wood wheel baby, and riding chrome (I'm riding chrome)\nThis is for the real playas, that get that do' (that get that do')\nTell me how it feel baby, to see I'm-I'm riding candy and chrome\nCatch me today, with a cannon or a Kodak\nCause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback\nCatch me today, with a cannon or a Kodak\nCause by tomorrow, yesterday gon be a throwback\n\n[Outro: Chamillionaire]\nKnow I'm saying, gripping wood\nRiding through the hood, and feeling good\nJust like we say down in Texas, it's already\nYou staring at me so hard\nYou need to go on, do yourself a favor playa\nAnd take a motherfucking picture2Embed"
