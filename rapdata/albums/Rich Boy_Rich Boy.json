Hold on Polow man stop throwin' money man\nLet me see what's happenin' wit' this man\n\n[Hook]\nIt's one thing I gotta ask, can I touch that ass?\nTouch that ass, yeah touch that ass\nIf I fly ya first class, can I touch that ass?\nTouch that ass, yeah touch that ass\nNow I don't mind throwin' cash, can I touch that ass?\nTouch that ass, yeah touch that ass\nYa homegirl kinda bad, can I touch her ass?\nTouch her ass, yeah touch her ass\n[Verse 1]\nCatch me on Cheetah's wit a down dick eater\nStandin' on the block in a fresh wife beater\nFilet mignon, me and Polow Da Don\nWhy they call you Rich Boy? Look at my charm\nLook at my bracelet and look at my arm\nShakin' my wrist might just start a snowstorm\nUp in the club and we gettin' it on\nPoppin' big bottles and spillin' Patron\nD-Boys be the squad Zone 4 be the label\nGot a 645 wit' the satellite cable\nThey say I wouldn't make it but I still made it happen\nOne point three mill' and just start rappin'\nYeah I got a room when you suck on my dick\nCause if you suck on my dick you better swallow that shit\nYa young bitch, niggas still runnin they mouth\n*gunshots*\n\n[Hook]\n\n[Verse 2]\nOne dollar, two dollar, three dollar, four\nWhen I leave the club I take two whores\nMaybe one more, back to the Doubletree\nHoes wanna double me and sip bubbly\nLet's play a lil' game, Simon Says\nSimon Says \"why don't you give Rich Boy some head?\"\nNo lie, I'm a cool dude\nNot tryin' to be rude, just tryin' to touch you\nYeah, I'm lookin' for that super dome\nI ain't talkin' 'bout the field they throw the ball on\nI'm a ball on, make that ass roll\nPussy look like gold comin' down that pole\nGot the whole club out of control\nFake ballers in the bitch throwin' rent money, stupid bitch\nI laugh at that shit, what you wanna do?\nI got hundred dollar bills, tens and twenties too\nYou might also like[Hook]\n\n[Verse 3]\nI'm takin' my money and spendin' it all\nAll these thick girls that I wanna take home\nThrowin' big faces until they all gone\nWhile I watch all these girls take off they thong\nMr. DJ won't you turn up my song\nBouncin' that ass I don't see nothin' wrong\nOne bitch, two or three bankrolls\nEighty-five thousand dollars worth of Russian rose gold\nTake a picture of ya broad, put it in my iPod\nShe lick it dry clean when my dick get hard\nAin't playin' wit'cha baby can I get a lil' grip\nSpend a couple chips, I break ya off a big tip\n\n[Hook]Embed"
