Cause you ain't\nWhy do you think that you are all that? Cause you ain't\nWhy do you think that you are all that? Cause you ain't, motherfucka\n\nYeah that's the way is goes\nDiesel from the the land of the Raiders holmes\nYou played yourself trying to fade the Del\nFonica any lyric that you comment on\nCause niggas will say damn, you kinda dumb\nI'm too sly and cunning 100 miles and running\nOn diesel power So see you cowards\nI'm pleasing thousands but you ain't leaving housing\nStop the evil frowning\nAsk your people to teach you countenance\nWhile I create beats to keep you bouncing\nWith aftershocks that eat through mountains\nSince the 70's my pedigree get cheddar cheese\nWhen I used to read Jets and Ebony's\nI bet I reach even the hardest g's\nCause my artistry ain't to hard to see\nStay far from me D love the bop\nD-Bo wanna see your bubble pop\n\n(Chorus)\nWhy do you think that you are all that? You ain't\nWhy do you think that you are all that? You ain't\nWhy do you think that you are all that? You ain't, motherfucka\nYou might also likeYeah, I go coo coo for afro puffs\nIn blue jeans with a massive ass be stuffed\nI come to see lovely honeys, that's what's up\nNot you money hungry hoes who be fast as fuck\nYou're ass is stuck in la la land\nThe next morning talking about how dry I am\nTell people I'm mean, damn right I am\nBut what you like so bad is that I'm like your dad\nA hoe will compromise\nThemselves for pleasures they want at the time\nDo anything for anybody\nNow you tell me who's really sorry\nYou used to have an appealing body\nTill you let niggas ride the wheels off the trolley\nYou probably feel that you're still not a harlot\nYou see me and then you feel all retarded\nHoes will sell your love for knots\nA dub what, get yo bubble popped, bitch\n\n(Chorus)\nWhy do you think that you are all that? You ain't (Repeat 4x)\n\nDel ad-lib with the chorusEmbed"
