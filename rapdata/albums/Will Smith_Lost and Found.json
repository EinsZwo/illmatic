Dude's resilient\nFresh Prince was hot, the movies killed him\nWait, hold up, Stop! You can rebuild him\nLock him back in hip-hop while dude's not filmin'\nShocked by the film and the TV money\nWent from scenes with Uncle Phil to scenes with Sonny\nIt's so hard to break free from a guaranteed 20\nBut it's done, so come see the MC honey!\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nHere he comes, he can rock\nHe can breakdance and he can pop\nHe can rap, and he can act\nAnd if it come down to it he can scrap\nHey there, here come Big Will again\n\n[Bridge]\nEvery time he touch the mic\nHe close his eyes and he hope to shine\nAnd like a streak of light\nIntro his name, they be like \"ahhhh!\"\n\n[Chorus]\nHere he comes, he can rock\nHe can breakdance and he can pop\nHe can rap, and he can act\nAnd if it come down to it he can scrap\nHey there, here come Big Will again\n\n[Outro]\nHere come Big Will again\nHere come Big Will again!1Embed"

I'm the party starter\nYou might have a good time but we party harder\nSo, tell the DJ to play my song\nAnd we can dance all night to the early morning\n\n[Verse 1]\nDance, an afrodesiac\nWomen gyrating, simulating sensual acts\nTo stimulatin musical tracks\nI thought I was just gon' come out at night and get a brew and relax\nBut no! Uh-uh, when you the party starter\nIt's like, you on call, you what the doctor ordered\nIt's like you gotta block the border to the door and\nShock 'em when it's boring, get on the floor!\nUhh, it's the groovicide bomber\nMic in my vest tight, strapped to my chest like\nI'm a run up in the party holla and\nBe like, oh! Fulfilling my calling\nBig, Will, that's my name\nWriting, rhymes, that's my game\nAsk me again and I'll tell you the same\nLook, just write your number right next to your name girl\n[Chorus]\nOhh! I'm the party starter\nYou might have a good time but we party harder\nSo, tell the DJ to play my song\nAnd we can dance all night to the early morning\n\n[Verse 2]\nHe was raised in the days when the roof was raised and\nEvery rap occasion, new and amazing\nThe back of the stage is amazed and gazing\nPraying for the day they can one day praise him\nStudied the ways of the game and made it\nCame through the maze and the haze and played it\nPerfect, dazed any person hated\nAnd cursed 'em, he was unfazed, he waited\nIt was worth it, he never retaliated\nHe saved it, slaving, on the road blazing\nDazed when he was low, nothing could raise him\nAnd came to the show and something uncaged in him\nLike the pope of this party crusade\nI'm like braids, that's never gon' fade, ya heard?\nI'm like, 23's on an Escalade\nThrow me into the rave like you threw a grenade, boom!\n\n[Chorus]\nOhh! I'm the party starter\nYou might have a good time but we party harder\nSo, tell the DJ to play my song\nAnd we can dance all night to the early morning\nYou might also like[Verse 3]\nI call for the days of the unadulterated\nWhen the artistry was cultivated\nYou know back when rap was smart and multi-layered\nWe can rap without A&R's and ultimatums, damn!\nNow today I say the praise, I long for the good old days\nWhen the party was all about partying\nI was a mini-party starter then\nMy mind bends when I call my pen\nThe big question, should I run to mine a vittle\nFood for thought or, dumb the rhyme a little?\nBut Will if you come too high\nThat'll alienate folks, and they won't buy it\nYo, look, people getting trapped in the track\nAnd they be clapping, even when the rappin is wack\nAnd what happened? When did we get happy with that?\nHe old-fashioned? Yup! Well let's be happy he back, ya heard me?\n\n[Chorus]\nOhh! I'm the party starter\nYou might have a good time but we party harder\nSo, tell the DJ to play my song\nAnd we can dance all night to the early morning5Embed"

And can't wait to tell\nIf I don't believe what you believe I'm goin to hell\n[Verse One: Will Smith]\nYo, I've been down with Jesus since Sunday school and Easter speeches\nThe, bible was survival that's what my grandma would teach us\nSince I was 5 I've been dyin and tryin to read it\nAnd when I did, it redefined it\nNow you was 34 when you found Jesus after your life fell to pieces\nWife two times with two guys, now enlightening speeches\nSeem to flow out your mouth with the hype of a preacher\nTook your whole life to reach ya, now I'm a triflin creature?\n\n[Hook: Will Smith]\nMs. Holy Roller, new angel\nWit'cha bible out shoutin and you ringin a bell\nMid-life, REBORN! And can't wait to tell\nIf I don't believe what you believe I'm goin to hell\n\n[Will Smith]\nC'mon, if I die right this second, I reckon that God\nWould simply check into my life and times, dissectin my rhymes\nHe'll see how I've been leadin his troops\nYou can't do dirt your whole life and say - OOPS!\n\n[Interlude: Will Smith]\nNow where was Jesus when you was cheatin and you was deceivin me?\nWhere was Jesus when you was greedy, your lawyers was bleedin me?\nWhere was Jesus when every weekend, a new man was livin wit'chu\nOh wait, he was with me, tryin to keep me from killin you!\nNow where was Jesus when you was lyin and you was betrayin me?\nWhen I was tryin to make it and you was hatin delayin me huh?\nWhere was Jesus when the ICE was thrillin ya?\nOh wait, he was with me, tryin to keep me from killin ya!\nYou might also like[Verse Two: Will Smith]\nIf I ain't know Jesus, ain't no tellin where I would be\nIt's been nights I felt like faeces, I needed to fight to release it\nI'm in the limelight, it's hot and the heat is ceaseless and\nHoldin my tongue while lil' bums cut me to pieces\nThe only reason's cause I studied the life of Jesus and\nVentin with my pen and intendin to write and release it\nBut when an ex-friend slight me and slam me with venom\nI hate it, I can't stand, damn it I really resent it\nI always strive to be righteous, my version of God\nThe reason why I never write rap verses with curses inside\nThe reason I never purposely hurt persons I've applied\nMany teachings of God, searchin the reaches of God\nPondered the mysteries of why you be dissin me\nI adore you, all I hope for you is freedom from misery\nYou made mistakes and blunders, you breakin from under but yo\nIf I'm goin to hell, it's makin me wonder\n\n[Interlude: Will Smith]\nThe greatest atrocities ever committed on this planet have been in the name of God\nThis country was founded by the Puritans for the express purpose of oppression free worship\nYour attitude is the same arrogant, fearful fundamentalism\nThat fueled the hatred of the Crusades and the attacks of 9/11\nIf we are not allowed to worship God as groups and individuals free from persecution\nAnd respect for tolerance, there's only one outcome\n[Hook: Will Smith]\nMs. Holy Roller, new angel\nWit'cha bible out shoutin and you ringin a bell\nMid-life, REBORN! And can't wait to tell\nIf I don't believe what you believe I'm goin to hell, yo\nMs. Holy Roller, new angel\nWit'cha bible out shoutin and you ringin a bell\nMid-life, REBORN!

That was my intention\nI paid dues, now dudes pay attention\nI live for it, even though the flicks is hittin\nCrib's sick, you can see the booth from the kitchen\nSpeak on it, cause I saw it happen\nThis is hip-hop, dawg I ain't just rappin\nY'all lookin at a real MC man\nYou couldn't check a mic from me\n[Hook: Will Smith]\nWhy should I try to sound like y'all sound?\nThat's what's wrong with the rap game right now\nWhy should I try to flow, the way y'all flow\nOr do a show like y'all show, nah that ain't where my head at now\nY'all in the hip-hop lost and found\nThat's what's wrong with the rap game right now\nMan it's like a circus with a bunch of clowns\nWith a bunch of cliques I'll probably rap circles around\n\n[Verse Two: Will Smith]\nLet's talk about rhyme capability\nLet's talk about hip-hop versatility\nLet's talk about takin the game beyond\nHow the hell we gon' have a battle of wits? Trick you unarmed\nLet's talk about love for the game\nI mean real love, back before there was fame\nI'm real with it, I ain't claimin to reign\nBut when y'all talk about rap, y'all gon' start sayin my name\nF'real though, I ain't playin\nPlenty of y'all love a brother, just scared to say it\nYo, first ever rap Grammy\nLet's talk about the only reason yo' ass went to Miami - yup!\nTruck with rims - check; throwback jersey - check\nChampagne bottles - check; lots of models - DAMN!\nThat's the list for 90% of y'all videos and songs\nAm I WRONG?!\nYou might also like[Hook: Will Smith]\nWhy should I try to sound like y'all sound?\nThat's what's wrong with the rap game right now\nWhy should I try to flow, the way y'all flow\nOr do a show like y'all show, nah that ain't where my head at now\nY'all in the hip-hop lost and found\nThat's what's wrong with the rap game right now\nMan it's like a circus with a bunch of clowns\nWith a bunch of cliques I'll probably rap circles around\n\n[Verse Three: Will Smith]\nLost - when you a slave to the biz\nWith no care for the cost of what you sayin to kids\nFound is when your lyrics are a test of time\nAnd your mind hear that your spirit is blessed divine\nLost is when you rhyme 'til your throat gets sore\nBut you don't even believe what you say no more\nFound is when you bleed heart into the mic\nAnd the pain you sustain it could change a life\nLost is when you hide behind the freedom of speech\nWell sure you're free to do it, but what it mean to do it\nDid you mean to do it? Did you need to do it?\nDid you take time to think about the seed you ruined? (HUH?)\nFound is Esco, Dead Prez and them\nFound is Lauryn Hill\nFound is Rakim\nFound can be you if you felt the message\nAnd ask yourself this question\n[Hook: Will Smith]\nWhy should I try to sound like y'all sound?\nThat's what's wrong with the rap game right now\nWhy should I try to flow, the way y'all flow\nOr do a show like y'all show, nah that ain't where my head at now\nY'all in the hip-hop lost and found\nThat's what's wrong with the rap game right now\nMan it's like a circus with a bunch of clowns\nWith a bunch of cliques I'll probably rap circles around\nWhy should I try to sound like y'all sound?\nThat's what's wrong with the rap game right now\nWhy should I try to flow, the way y'all flow\nOr do a show like y'all show, nah that ain't where my head at now\nY'all in the hip-hop lost and found\nThat's what's wrong with the rap game right now\nMan it's like a circus with a bunch of clowns\nWith a bunch of cliques I'll probably rap circles aroundEmbed"

Then the less you do, the better\nCause women equate dance with sex\nThey gon' see you, and be like, next\nBut you gon' be like, hold up ma!, next\nBut she gon' be like, uh-uh pah!, next\nNow looka here, rule number one, know your name\nIt ain't Usher, Justin, Hammer?

Nah man, a piece of me\nBut you can't see it that when you be dancing B\nAs I asked you a question that's how you answer me\nSo when you don't dance it be like I'm choking from cancer\nLike I wrote rancid rhymes, I can't survive, sure\nI rationalize, like oh I see\nBut if you don't like my cut it's like you don't like me\nSome stuff works, some works, not so well\nIt's like you work like hell, still get hurt like hell\nYo, it can tear you apart\nBut don't let your wins go to your head, your losses go to your heart\nAnd if we ever get the pleasure to meet\nBe clever wit and please measure what you yell in the street, c'mon\nYou might also like[Hook]\nCould you love me in the shack in a shanty town?\nCould you love me if my pants was hand-me-down?\nCould you love me if my wrists ain't bling?\nIf I wasn't on TV, and I ain't sing, huh?\nCould you love me if my whip wasn't chrome fitted?\nWill my name be easier to forget it, huh?\nCould you love me if my wrists ain't bling?\nIf I wasn't on TV, and I ain't sing, huh?Embed"
