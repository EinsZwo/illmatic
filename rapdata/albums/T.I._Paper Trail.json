You know what they said?\nThey said, had he had a strap, he'da lived today. You know what I'm sayin?\nNow, true enough, I was dead wrong, I broke the law, I deserve to be punished. I understand that, aight? Cool. But listen, man, I got a house full of kids, a mama, and an old lady, whose life is my responsibility. You dig that?\nNow, for all of y'all who think I was just ridin' around on some dumb shit: you know I'm smarter than you man! You know I'm smarter than you dawg! Ay, if you think I was just being stupid, shawty, I got some muhfuckin' oceanfront property in Idaho for sale, homie. If you believe that, I got a bridge in Brooklyn I wanna sell you, partner\nAy, man, real talk: In order to understand my train of thoughts, you have to put yourself in my position. You can't expect me to think like you, 'cause my life ain't like yours, you know what I'm sayin?\nIf you don't understand that, you don't understand English. I'm done talking5Embed"

A-Town, connect!\n(Know the city gon' feel this) Damn right!\nSay Toot, I know you see me\n('Cris!) What up, boy?\nI know both our pops lookin at us\nWayne Bridges, what up? Let's go!\n(Big Phil, we made this shit happen, homie)\nHistory in the makin'! (Momma I did it!)\n[Chorus: B.o.B.]\nI used to dream (I used to dream) ohh-whoa (ohh!)\nAbout the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)\nBut now I sing (now I sing) ohh-whoa! (ohh!)\nBecause I'm sitting on top of the world! (the whole world)\nAnd now I sing (ay) sing (ay) sing (ay) sing (ay)\nCause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, ay, ay)\nAnd now I sing (ay) sing (ay) sing (ay) sing (ay)\nCause I'm sittin on top of the world! (ay, ay, yeah, yeah)\n\n[Verse 1: T.I.]\nMan, I remember, 'fore I say that, wait, let me issue this statement\nNo way should reflection be mistaken for glorification\nNow, I remember so vivid, me and my niggas was livin'\nSub-standard condition, still handling business\nStill laughin' and trippin', still having the bitches\nI'm rapping now, reminiscing, and goddamn it, we did it\nFrom trappin', standin' & pitchin' with rich we stand in the kitchen\nSplittin' it eight ways, flip it in eight days\nThought that wild and unruly was just the way to behave\nKept the weight and the yay', but most the paper we made\nIn all dimes, I ain't lyin, the pleasure was all mine\nHad big work to move, but we served the small time\nI always outshined the niggas with small minds\nWho woulda thought we'd be arguably the greatest of all time\n'Round here? we develop such a sound down here\nBeen duplicated often, still, can only be found here\nOnly listen to Gs, that other shit I don't hear\nShit, they so far in the rear, why would I even care?\nI'm too busy a player, steering niggas careers\nBeen talkin 'bout it for years, and now we finally here\nYou might also like[Chorus: B.o.B.]\nI used to dream (I used to dream) ohh-whoa (ohh!)\nAbout the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)\nBut now I sing (now I sing) ohh-whoa!

Jackson, like, \"Wassup, motherfucker?!\"\n[Chorus: B.o.B.]\nI used to dream (I used to dream) ohh-whoa (ohh!)\nAbout the money and the cars and girls (and the girls)\nBut now I sing (now I sing) ohh-whoa!

Yeah I know (haha!)\nHere I go, yeah, no matter what shawty, here I go\nNo matter what, shawty\n\n[Verse 2]\nYou let the blog sites and the magazines tell it\nI'm sure to be in jail until 2027\nRather see me in the cell instead of this new McLaren\nGod will take you through Hell just to get you to Heaven\nSo even though it's heavy, the load I will carry\nGrin and still bear it, win and still share it\nApologies to the fans, I hope you can understand it\nLife can change your directions, even when you ain't planned it\nAll you can do is handle, worst thing you can do is panic\nUse it to your advantage, avoid insanity, manage to conquer\nEvery obstacle, make impossible possible\nEven when winning illogical, losing's still far from optional, and\nYeah, they wanna see you shot up in the hospital\nBut when life throw punches, block and counter like a boxer do\nBeen locked inside mi casa too long, I did a song\nTo make it known that the King lives on, pimpin'\nYou might also like[Hook]\nI ain't dead (nah!), I ain't done (nah!)\nI ain't scared (of what?), I ain't run (from who?)\nBut still I stand (yeah) No matter what, people\nHere I am, yeah, no matter what, remember\nI ain't break (never), I ain't fold (never)\nThey hate me more (so?)

I ain't perfect\nNeither is anybody else, but I think my kids deserve\nTo be with Daddy out in public without all the interruptions\nWhen the lies and gossip's published I'm the topic of discussion\nAnd I stay in trouble just to show these suckers I ain't lost it\nAnd I'd do it all again that's the funny thing about it\nI ain't playing, boy I'm 'bout it, will I change, boy I doubt it\nI done been a lot of things, I ain't never been a coward\nSee the paparazzi crowded all around me now\nSame niggas who was dissin' want a pound like I'm C now\nShowered with support from my adoring fans\nThey hear T.I.'s arrested they're like here we go again\nYou might also like[Chorus: Usher]\nMy life, your entertainment\nYou watch it while I live it (live it)\nI walk they follow (ay)\nI talk they holla (ay)\nJust here for your amusement\nMy life, your entertainment\nYou watch it while I live it (live it)\nYou waitin' for me to lose it\nI guess I'm just here for your amusement\n\n[Verse 2: T.I.]\nYou've seen it all before, guys know how the story goes\nIt's like 2Pac never died, sit back, enjoy the show\nYou see the shit that scares you senseless, I done lived through it\nKnew the risks and the consequences and I still do it\nAnd then I'm so fresh, them niggas mildew it\nNot just a actor by profession, pimp, I live movies\nThat's why they whisper when they see me, point and stare at me\nCause they just wanna live through me vicariously\nFashion weekend, Paris week, party like a rockstar\nGet blown by a top model 'til she catch lockjaw\nGot the dough you get a year, stashed in my sock drawer\nShowed you the troubles and the struggles of an outlaw\nTop dog would not fall, I am not y'all\nCouple pages out the calendar and I'm out y'all\nKid listen, pay attention, you don't wanna be me\nIt's safer to watch it on T.V\n[Chorus: Usher]\nMy life, your entertainment\nYou watch it while I live it (live it)\nI walk they follow (ay)\nI talk they holla (ay)\nJust here for your amusement\nMy life, your entertainment\nYou watch it while I live it (live it)\nYou waitin' for me to lose it\nI guess I'm just here for your amusement\n\n[Verse 3: Usher]\nSee I don't think it would even matter (to me)\nWoking a nine to (five) would it be better, I mean be honest\nWould you care to gossip about me, not likely\nI guess that's just the way that it goes (the way that it goes)\n(Cause I know) See I can be somewhere out keeping it cool\n(And get told) Almost anything instead of the truth\nY'all know more than I do, it's breaking news to me too\nEasy killer y'all know that ain't how I move (ooh)\nHe said and she said (what) I did what, with they (who)\nNo not me I said (not me) she gave me no head (ooh)\nWon't get me again (hey) I pleaded the fifth (hey)\nI know better than to ever talk during the film...\nIn' and flashing lights can blind your eyesight\nTo when you can't see what's wrong from right\nWell shorty 'til you walk a mile in my shoes\nAnd understand this is who I am\n\n[Verse 4: T.I.]\nUsher I completely concur\nLife can be such a blur, obviously we prefer\nOur privacy but instead we endure\nYes sir, don't expect nothin' less of me\nCause this goin' probably be this way until the death of me\nBut for the hustle and the lady on my arm now\nPlus all my kids and my mom's I'm a calm down\nAnd yo, we doin' just fine, and the time's just flyin'\nLive one headline at a time\n\n[Chorus: Usher]\nMy life, your entertainment\nYou watch it while I live it (live it)\nI walk they follow (ay)\nI talk they holla (ay)\nJust here for your amusement\nMy life, your entertainment\nYou watch it while I live it (live it)\nYou waitin' for me to lose it\nI guess I'm just here for your amusement1Embed"
