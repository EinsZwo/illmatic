Jail bait! Jail bait!\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j jail bait\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j jail bait\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j jail bait\n\nJail bait\nShe's just jail bait\nJail bait\nShe's just jail bait\nJail bait\nShe's just jail bait\nJail bait\nShe's just jail bait\n\nDon't be Chester!\nChild molester!\n\nDon't be Chester child molester\nDon't be Chester child molester\n\nDon't be dumb!\nShe's just too young!\n\nAs time progressed my defenses grew weaker\nThe voice inside my head said go ahead and freak her\nDon't think it's wrong or feel remorse\nGet her alone and let nature take its course\nKeep it to yourself and tell no other\nWhat we do is strictly undercover\nThen she agreed and said proceed\nJust because I'm young don't mean I'm na\u00efve\nBut every time I think of your tender age\nI hear the door slam to a prisoner's cage\nSo I said save it for a rainy day\nBut then the game ended did it any old way\nFrom the pressure her physique put up on my brain\nI had to do something to release the strain\nI always regret it to the very end\nIf I had to do it over, I'd do it again\nI couldn't resist her natural beauty\nBeing a man I felt it was my duty\nTo bust her out her shell and her cocoon\nAt the right time, not too late or too soon\nAnd at that moment something told me to wait\nAnd then it said Jay, don't wait too late\nBut then I realized, I can't debate\nShe's just jail bait!\n\nJail bait\nShe's just jail bait\nJail bait\nShe's just jail bait\nJail bait\nShe's just jail bait\nJail bait\nShe's just jail bait\n\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j jail bait\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j jail bait\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j jail bait\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j jail bait\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j jail bait\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j jail bait\n\nDon't be Chester!\nChild molester!\n\nDon't be Chester child molester\nDon't be Chester child molester\n\nDon't be dumb!\nShe's just too young!\n\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j jail bait\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j jail bait\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j jail bait\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j\nJ-j-j-j-j-j-j-j jail bait\n\nJail bait!\n(Jail bait)Embed"

Because he was jealous\n\n[Chorus]\nIn today's society\nThere's this thing called jealousy\nThat takes control of you and me\nBut that's not how it's supposed to be\nIn today's society\nThere's this thing called jealousy\nThat takes control of you and me\nBut that's not how it's supposed to be\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhat people do and what people say\nDon't mean they won't be jealous of you some day\nHave you ever seen the eyes of a jealous friend?\nHe'll never stick by you through thick and thin\nThey'll talk about this and talk about that\nAnd talk about you behind your back\nOr you might have a girl that another guy likes\nHe wants her so bad he's willing to fight\nHe can't accept the fact of reality\nThat his homeboy's full of jealousy\nFighting over girls is really outrageous\nDon't let jealousy become contagious\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nIn today's society\nThere's this thing called jealousy\nThat takes control of you and me\nBut that's not how it's supposed to be\nIn today's society\nThere's this thing called jealousy\nThat takes control of you and me\nBut that's not how it's supposed to beEmbed"

Lyrics[Chorus 1]\nFreak don't wanna party\nFreak don't want romance\nFreak can't give it up, no play\nShe came to the set D.O.A., uh D.O.A\nFreak don't wanna party\nFreak don't want romance (Freak don't want romance)\nFreak can't give it up, no play (Freak can't give it up, no play)\nShe came to the set D.O.A. (She came to the set...)\n\n[Verse 1: Mr. Jay]\nD.O.A. (Hit it!)\nI walk through the door and I can see that she was bored\nSo I said \"What's your name?\" and she started to play games\nI said \"Baby, what is wrong? Don't you know, I got it going on\"\nAnd she said \"J, I have heard, about you, the latest word\"\nAnd all the rumors, she believed, so I put my [?] down, I must leave\nDon't you know I got class, and I'm debonair\nAnd contrary to rumor I'm all out there\nThen she started acting rude, and she got an attitude\nAnd I said \"Since you wanna be alone, somebody take this dead girl home\" 'cause the...\n[Chorus 2]\nFreak don't wanna party\nFreak don't want romance\nFreak can't give it up, no play\nShe came to the set D.O.A\nBitch don't wanna party\nFreak don't want romance\nFreak can't give it up, no play\nShe came to the set D.O.A\nA D.O.A\n\n[Verse 2: D-Rock-D]\nFrom the way she acted and the way her body packed it\nShe stimulated my attention, and my kinkiness reacted\nShe was standing on the wall, with a black lace camisole\nI said \"Sexy, won't you dance?\", but she said \"Sorry, there's no chance\"\nI told her \"Baby, what's the deal? You don't know how you make D-Rock feel\nI want to take you home with all that lace and just make love on the fireplace\nWe'll drink champagne and have some laughs, and then afterwards I'll give you a bath\nLay you to rest in satin sheets and kiss my way up from your seat\"\nThen J said...\n\n[Chorus 2]\nFreak don't wanna party\nFreak don't want romance\nFreak can't give it up, no play\nShe came to the set D.O.A\nBitch don't wanna party\nFreak don't want romance\nFreak can't give it up, no play\nShe came to the set D.O.A\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nI think she needs a revival\nShe came here dead on arrival\nI think she needs a revival\nShe came here dead on arrival\nD.O.A\n\n[Verse 3: Lemon Lime]\nSee this girl at a party that had caught my eye\nSo I thought to myself, yes I would try\nTo grab her by the hand so we could dance\nBut quickly to the bathroom she had ran\nOh my, oh my, is it something I said?\nOr is it that my rap is dead?\nNah, it couldn't be, my rhyme is too def\nRight now, Lemon Lime is above the rest\nI waited 'til she came out the ladies room\nAnd at the moment [?]\nThat she could be my girl for the rest of the night\nBut something inside didn't feel alright\nBut then I kept thinking to myself\nI better try to find me somebody else\nBecause a high-pitched voice said \"Get away\nHave you heard Lemon Lime, she's D.O.A.!\"\n\n[Chorus 2]\nFreak don't wanna party\nFreak don't want romance\nFreak can't give it up, no play\nShe came to the set D.O.A\nFreak don't wanna party\nFreak don't want romance\nFreak can't give it up, no play\nShe came to the set D.O.A\n[Bridge]\nI think she needs a revival\nShe came here dead on arrival\nI think she needs a revival\nShe came here dead on arrival\nD.O.A\n\n[Chorus 1]\nFreak don't wanna party\nFreak don't want romance\nFreak can't give it up, no play\nShe came to the set D.O.A., uh D.O.A (another one!)\nFreak don't wanna party (Freak don't wanna party)\nFreak don't want romance (Freak don't want romance)\nFreak can't give it up, no play (Freak can't give it up, no play)\nShe came to the set D.O.A. (she came to the set D.O.A.)\n\n[Chorus 3]\nEverybody!\nFreak don't wanna party\nFreak don't want romance\nFreak can't give it up, no play\nShe came to the set D.O.A\nFreak don't wanna party\nFreak wanna be alone\nFreak don't have a name\nSomebody take this dead freak home\nFreak don't wanna party\nFreak don't want romance\nFreak ain't giving up no play\nShe came to the set D.O.A\nFreak don't wanna party\nFreak wanna be alone\nFreak don't have a name\nSomebody take this dead freak home\n\n[Instrumental]\n\n[Chorus 3]\nFreak don't wanna party\nFreak don't want romance\nFreak can't give it up, no play\nShe came to the set D.O.A\nFreak don't wanna party\nFreak wanna be alone\nFreak don't have a name\nSomebody take this dead freak home, this dead freak home\nHit me!\n\n[Outro]\nJust take her home, just take her home\nWon't let me bone, just take her home\nJust take her home, just take her home\nWon't let me bone, just take her home\nJust take her home, just take her home\nWon't let me bone, just take her home\nJust take her home, just take her home\nWon't let me bone, just take her home\nShe was D.O.A\nShe was D.O.A\nShe was D.O.AEmbed"
