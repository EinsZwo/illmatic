  "plain": "Insane Clown Posse is a horrorcore rap group currently consisting of Violent J and Shaggy 2 Dope, with a majority of their rap focusing around The Dark Carnival, using Joker\u2019s Cards to explain such, with the first deck spanning from their debut album, Carnival of Carnage, to their sixth album, The Wraith, Shangri-La and Hell\u2019s Pit, and the second deck spanning Bang! Pow! Boom! onwards, with the most recent Joker\u2019s Card as of this writing being their 2021 album Yum Yum Bedlam. After the conclusion of the second deck, they intend to release a third deck of Joker\u2019s Cards consisting of five albums, followed by their retirement. The group is known for having a large fanbase known as Juggalos, painting themselves in the face paint of the two members and using Faygo as their arc drink."

Right?\nThis shit'll blow your motherfuckin' mind\n(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)\n\n[Verse 2: Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]\nMusic is a lot like love, it's all a feeling\nAnd it fills the room from the floor to the ceiling\nI see miracles all around me\nStop and look around, it's all astounding\nWater, fire, air and dirt\nFucking magnets, how do they work?\nAnd I don't wanna talk to a scientist\nY'all motherfuckers lying, and getting me pissed\nSolar eclipse, and vicious weather\nFifteen thousand Juggalos together\nAnd I love my mom, for giving me this\nTime on this planet, taking nothing for granted\nI seen a caterpillar turn into a butterfly\nMiracles ain't nothing to lie\nShaggy's little boys look just like Shaggy\nAnd my little boy looks just like daddy\nMiracles each and everywhere you look\nAnd nobody has to stay where they put\nThis world is yours, for you to explore\nIt's nothing but miracles beyond your door\nThe Dark Carnival is your invitation\nTo witness that without explanation\nTake a look at this fine creation\nAnd enjoy it better with appreciation\nCrows, ghosts, the midnight coast\nThe wonders of the world, mysteries the most\nJust open your mind, and it ain't no way\nTo ignore the miracles of every day\nAnd that's real\nYou might also like[Chorus: Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]\n(Are you a believer in miracles?)\nMagic everywhere in this bitch\n(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)\nIt's all around you, you don't even know it\n(Are you a believer in miracles?) Shit's crazy\n(Do you notice and recognize miracles?)\n(So many miracles, the magic miracles)\n\n[Outro]\nAre you a believer in miracles?\nDo you have time for the miracles?\nDo you notice and recognize miracles?\nSo many miracles, the magic miracles\n\n[Skit]\nWell, we're here! We came all the way to Ash, Nevada!\nCome on!\nWhere's the show and where's our money?\nI came all the way from England! Where's me bloody 'undred thousand pounds?\nWhat I wanna know is where in hell is my goddamn hundred thousand dollars?\nAnd where can I get some beer in this motherfucker?\nI thought this was a carnival. Where's all the sexy kids at? Don't tell me I brought all this candy for nothing!\nI didn't come all this way to stand around here with all these goddamn tadpoles! Let's get a move on!\nStart this shit so we can get paid!\nWe came a long way to see this shit! It'd better be worth it, or Imma kill somebody! Mother fucker!19Embed"

Let's find out if his charm will work on Sharon. Sharon, what's your question?\"\n\n[Sharon]\n\"Contestant number one, I believe first impressions last forever. So let's say you were to come over to my parent's house and have dinner with me and my family. Tell me what you would do to make that first impression really stick\"\n\n[Verse 1: Violent J]\nLet's see, mm, well, I'd have to think about it\nI might show up in a tux, HA!, but I doubt it\nI'd probably just show up naked like I always do\nAnd look your momma in the eye and tell her, \"FUCK YOU!!!\"\nHurry up, bitch, I'm hungry, I smell spaghetti\nI'd pinch her loopy ass and tell her, \"Get the food ready!\"\nYour dad will probably start trippin' and get me pissed\nI'd have to walk up and bust him in his fucking lips!\nIt's dinner time, we hearing grace from your mother\nI'd pull a forty out and pour some for your little brother\nI'm steady staring at your sister, I'll tell you this\nYou know for only thirteen, she got some big tits\nAfter that, your dad will try to jump again\nAnd only this time, I'd put the forty to his chin\nAfter your mom does the dishes and the silverware\nI'd dry-fuck her till I nut in my underwear\n[Host]\n\"Now, let's meet contestant number two. He's a psychopathic, deranged, crackhead freak who works for the Dark Carnival. He says women call him Stretch Nuts. Sharon, let's hear your question\"\n\n[Sharon]\n\"I like a man who's not afraid to show his true emotions, a man who expresses himself in his own special way. Number two, if you fell in love with me Exactly how would you let me know?\"\n\n[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]\nFirst thing, I could never love you\nYou sound like a richie-bitch, yo, FUCK YOU!!!\nBut if I did, I'd probably show you that I care\nBy taking all these other motherfuckers outta here\nI'd go through your phone book and whack em all\nAnd find contestant number one and break his fucking jaw (What?!)\nAnyone who looked at you, would have to pay\nI'd be blowing fucking nuggets off all day\nI'd grab your titties and stretch 'em down past your waist\nLet 'em go, and watch 'em both spring up in your face\nI'd sing love songs to you, the best I can\nGet you naked, and hit it like a CAVEMAN!!!\nThen we'd go to the beach and walk through the sand\nI'd throw a little in your face and say, I'm just playin'\nAs you spit it all out, I'd rub your back\nAnd grab your underwear and wedge it up your ass crack!!\n\n[Host]\n\"Well it sounds like contestant number two is just over-flowing with sensitivity, Sharon. It's a tough choice so far! Sharon, let's have your last question and see which one is going to win the rights to your neden\"\nYou might also like[Sharon]\n\"Okay, if we were at a dance club, and you both noticed me at the same time. Tell me, how would you each get my attention, and what would your pick up line be?\" (Well) \"Whoever's the smoothest wins!\"\n\n[Verse 3: Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]\nOkay, first I'd slide up to the bar\nAnd tell you that I can't believe how fucking fat you are\nI'd tell you that I like the way you make your titties shake\nAnd if you lost a little weight, you'd look like Ricki Lake\nFuck that, you'd be jocking me quick\nI'd order you a drink and stir it with my dick\nAnd then to get your attention in the crowded place\nI'd simply walk up and stick my nuts in your face\nYeah, freak her with your nuts, yo, that'll get her\nTell her that's she fat, yeah, that'll work even better\nLook, fuck you, I got a strong rap\nShit, you don't want contestant number two. He's mad wack\nI walked into a barn and there he was\nStanding up on a bucket, eww, trying to fuck it\nIt was a big fucking smelly-ass farm llama\nDamn dawg! How you gonna diss your momma?!2Embed"

I sharpen my blade\nFrontin' to this perv like I'm only in the seventh grade\nThe doorbell rings, I gotta get them inside\nIn my best little girl's voice, I'm like, \"Hi!\nCome on in! I'm putting on my bikini!\"\nAnd when the door shuts, that's when I let them see me\n\"Hi there.\" (Haha) I stab him in the neck first\n'Cause it hurts. Hit him where the blood squirts\nCarve his whole face off and make him eat it\nChain him up by the foot in my basement, bleeding\n[Chorus]\nI'm probably gonna burn for this\nAin't no lesson to learn from this\nThere's nothing I'ma learn\nBut it sure is fun (To catch a predator)\nI said it sure is fun (To catch a predator)\nAnd it sure is fun (To catch a predator)\nI'm probably gonna burn for this\nAin't no lesson to learn from this\nThere's nothing I'ma earn\nBut it sure is fun (To catch a predator)\nI said it sure is fun (To catch a predator)\n\n[Verse 2: Violent J]\nSoon enough, Feds will be shutting down my service\n'Cause people out there think they don't deserve this\nUntil it's your kid an old man is finger fucking\nTitty sucking, then you'll want the knife stuck in\nI don't blame you, that's why I catch them in advance\nWhile his dick is still in his pants, they never get the chance\nI tell them I'm alone and I'm only thirteen\nLooking for a good time. Ya know what I mean?\n\"Bring me some Funyuns, and a Slurpee\nPromise not to hurt me, or give me herpes.\"\nAnd within twenty minutes, here comes a fucking doctor\nKnocking on my door, a pedophile butt knocker\n\"Come in! Have a seat!\" and then I stroll in\nWith the all-purpose hunting blade straight up his colon (Ahh!)\nI cut his hands off, he ain't touching nobody\nChain him up by the foot in the basement, bloody\nYou might also like\"Pla- pla- please Mr. Clown, sir, you don't have to do this!\"\n\"Zip it!\"\n\"Please! I got money! We ca-\"\n\"Shut it, fucker!\"\n\"Please! We can work this out!\"\n\"Silence I say!\"\n\nStick him next to this other fool. Both left for dead\nEvery time I walk by 'em, I punch them in the head\nCut they fucking dicks off, stick 'em in each other's mouths\n\"Now what y'all talkin' about!?\"\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm probably gonna burn for this\nAin't no lesson to learn from this\nThere's nothing I'ma earn\nBut it sure is fun (To catch a predator)\nI said it sure is fun (To catch a predator)\nAnd it sure is fun (To catch a predator)\nI'm probably gonna burn for this\nAin't no lesson to learn from this\nThere's nothing I'ma earn\nBut it sure is fun (To catch a predator)\nI said it sure is fun (To catch a predator)\n\n[Bridge]\n\"What's in the bag?\"\n\"Funyuns and condoms\"\n\"What's in the bag?\"\n\"Funyuns and condoms\"\n\"What's in the bag?\"\n\"Funyuns and condoms\"\n\"Why did you bring condoms?\"\n\"I didn't mean to\"\n[Verse 3: Violent J]\nThe house is getting funky, bodies in the basement, stinking\nWhat the fuck am I thinking?\nI put my face paint on, go downstairs\nAnd beat they ass sometimes, 'cause it ease my mind\nSome of them are dead, some are still living\nBut I'ma hurt them every chance that I'm given\nI hit em with the nail gun or the stun gun\nThey can't run! So, they both mad fun\nI was sawing a head off when I heard the doorbell\nI'm not expecting any predators, but oh well!\nI took my spot. \"Come in! I'll be right there!\"\nBut I left a head sitting on the living room chair!\nHe seen it and ran! I had to give chase!\nWe cut across the lawn with my knife swinging for his face!\nI threw it, it stuck him in the back of the neck\nStill in my drawers, I dragged him home a bloody wreck\n\n\"Ahhhh! Somebody! Anybody!\"\n\"Zip it!\"\n\"Stop! Please!\"\n\"Shut it the fuck up!\"\n\"Ahhhhhh!\"\n\"People are looking! Silence!\"\nA bus full of high school kids watched it happen\nHe kept screaming like a pansy, despite my slapping\nPlus, the neighbors seen it, and so did the mailman\nBut they all never said nothing bout it again\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm probably gonna burn for this\nAin't no lesson to learn from this\nThere's nothing I'ma earn\nBut it sure is fun (To catch a predator)\nI said it sure is fun (To catch a predator)\nAnd it sure is fun (To catch a predator)\nI'm probably gonna burn for this\nAin't no lesson to learn from this\nThere's nothing I'ma earn\nBut it sure is fun (To catch a predator)\nI said it sure is fun (To catch a predator)\n\n[Outro]\n\"Yo! Liz!\"\n\"Meanwhile, back at the house.\"\n\"Hey! Come on in! What kind of alcohol did you bring?'\n\"I brought Absolute Citron, I brought Mandarin Orange, I brought a shot of J\u00e4germeister\"\n\"Wow!\"\n\"In several cases, the men were asked to bring food, alcohol, and condoms. Law enforcement says this helps show an intent to solicit a minor. What do we got here?\"\n\"A bag of Funyuns\"\n\"Funyuns? What about condoms? Did you bring condoms?\"\n\"I did.\"\n\"You did?\"3Embed"

It only mentions the Carnival once, summing up the sole appearance as \u201cIf you don\u2019t like us, it\u2019s good; we accept that our style doesn\u2019t fit everyone.\u201d\n\nThe song was originally released for free on Insane Clown Posse\u2019s website as the second single from the first half of the Sixth Joker\u2019s Card, The Wraith: Shangri-La, before the album\u2019s release. The announcement post on the website said:\n\nCrossing thy Bridge was just one example of what\u2019s in store for the Sixth. The rock beat of this awesome song is just one sample of the ultimate freshness that awaits you. The second single is a mirror image of the first; an example of the mad rap flavor that you\u2019ve been itching for. And speaking of mirrors there is a special treat waiting with this single: Twiztid is in affect! That\u2019s right, Jamie Madrox and the Monoxide Child will be featured on this new single that we present to you. So if you want to hear the new single from Insane Clown Posse, and we know you do, download \u2018Juggalo Homies\u2019 here and kick back to the wig-splitting tunes.\n\nMost versions of the physical CD single release had the B-sides \u201cJuggalo Chant\u201d and Violent J\u2019s solo track \u201cBloody Bitch.\u201d"

(Motherfucker!)\nIf you wasn't blood, would you still have love?\nOr in fact does the blood make you think you have to love?\nLook I probably love my family more than anybody here\nBut my homies are family too, third cousins get outta here\nWho was you with when you got tatoos?\nWho was you tripping with when you did them mushrooms?\nAnd who the fuck threw up all over your car\nAnd then felt worse than you about that shit in the morning? (Friends ya'll)\n[Pre-Chorus: Shaggy 2 Dope]\nWho loaned ya money, homie? Who owes ya cash?\nWho taught you how to use a bong for the grass?\nI don't know much but I gotta assume\nWhen ya hit ya first neden, ya homies was in the other room\n\n[Chorus]\nWe talkin' about homies, homies\n(Talkin' about the road dogs of mine)\nOur motherfuckin' homies, homies (That's my dog)\n(We throwin' up Clown Love signs)\nReal Juggalo homies, homies\n(Talk 'bout the road dogs of mine) (Homies for everybody)\nHomies, homies (Man, that's my dog)\n\n[Verse 2: Violent J]\nHave you ever had a job that you truly despise?\nLike, I dunno, maybe dish washing or fucking flipping fries\nThen you've got this boss who thinks he's the Don Mega\nBecause he the head manager chief chili fry maker\nAll you could vision is ya'll beating him down\nYour homies standing on his back while you're kickin' his head around\nBut responsibility is there, I can't lie, though\nI'd have been plucked his fucking eyeball out with a chicken bone\nCrazy as fuck I'll rip your piercings off\nAnd now my homies are holding me back so I don't look soft\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus: Shaggy 2 Dope]\nWhen you snuck the car out who did you get?\nAnd when you got caught, on who'd you blame that shit?\nWho you relax around and scratch yo balls?\nHomies, I'm talking about like you and yours!\n\n[Chorus]\nWe talkin' about homies, homies (That's right)\n(Talkin' about the road dogs of mine)\nOur motherfuckin' homies, homies (Everybody, what)\n(We throwin' up Clown Love signs)\nReal Juggalo homies, homies (Everybody, what)\n(Talk 'bout the road dogs of mine) (Yeah, yeah)\nHomies, homies (Hey, hey, hey)\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nYou don't like me you can fuck on!

(Carnival ain't for everyone)\n(Runnin' with the homies 'til I'm old like [?])\n\n[Verse 3: Jamie Madrox]\nMe and my homies stay tight like a noose\nAnd if you step to one of us you betta step to the whole crew\nI never knew that I could depend\nThat I could have some friends that's down til the very end\nWell that's my home boys, excuse me, my family\nAnd when we conquer the world\nWe macking on the galaxy cause the skys the limit\nAnd we ain't finished\nAnd if my homies gonna ride ya know I'm with it\n[Verse 4: Monoxide]\nPuff it and pass it and I give it to my homies ya'll\nHit it and quit it and then I give it to my homies ya'll\nI got the world around my finger with my homies ya'll\nAnd everything is obsolete unless I hear my homies call\nWe worldwide, were homies across the planet\nSticking together like zippers on Michael Jackson's 'Beat It' jacket\nThey got my back like a tat for that, I love ya'll\nHanging till we old and grey like grandpas\n\n[Chorus]\n(Psychopathic) Homies, homies\n(Talkin' about the road dogs of mine)\nMy motherfuckin' homies, homies (Hey, hey)\n(We throwin' up Clown Love signs)\nReal Juggalo homies, homies\n(Talk about the road dogs of mine) (Hell yeah) (Juggalo homies)\nHomies, homies (Hey, hey, hey)\n\n[Post-Chorus]\nYou don't like me you can fuck on!

    "plain": "Slim Anus is a diss track made by ICP towards fellow detroit rapper, Eminem. Their feud started long ago, when Eminem, who was far less well-known than he is now, wrote on flyers promoting his SSEP release party that ICP will appear there(maybe), before asking them before. Violent J declined, enraging Eminem who took it as a personal offense and one of the most known beefs of the 00\u2019s began. Nowadays, however, ICP have long since settled this feud, and have said in interviews that they have no problem with him."

       "plain": "Slim Anus is a diss track made by ICP towards fellow detroit rapper, Eminem. Their feud started long ago, when Eminem, who was far less well-known than he is now, wrote on flyers promoting his SSEP release party that ICP will appear there(maybe), before asking them before. Violent J declined, enraging Eminem who took it as a personal offense and one of the most known beefs of the 00\u2019s began. Nowadays, however, ICP have long since settled this feud, and have said in interviews that they have no problem with him."

My name is who?\nMy name is Slim Anus\nHi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?\nMy name is the fudgepacker\nHi, my name is what? (Excuse me) My name is who?\nMy name is the nutlicker\n(Can I have the attention of your ass?)\nHi, my name is what? My name is who?\nMy name is the buttsniffer\n[Verse 1: Eminem, Jamie Madrox, Violent J]\nHi, kids! Do you like Anus?\nI let Dr. Dre fill up my butt for one chance to be famous (Uh huh)\nWanna copy me and do exactly like I did (Yeah)\nTry acid and get your butt pumped out like I did\nMy brain's dead weight, I'm tryin to get my head straight\nBut I can't figure out which Backstreet Boy I wanna impregnate\nAnd Dr. Dre said, \"Slim Shady you a cutie (Uh huh)\nI'll give you a deal let me up in that booty\" (OK!)\nWell since age 12 I felt like I'm someone else\nCause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt (Yup)\nGot pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off\nShe don't know how to do Tommy Lee, I'd suck his dick off\n\n[Chorus 2: Jamie Madrox]\nHi, my anus who? My anus what?\nMy anus, it gets tapped on\nHi, my anus (Excuse me) My anus\nMy anus every now and then gets plugged up\nHi, my anus (Can I have the attention of your ass?) My anus\nMy anus is occasionally reamed out\nHi, my anus, who? My anus, what?\nMy anus really needs to be filled up\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem & Jamie Madrox]\nMy English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high\nI told him to take his pants off, hooked him up, he let me slide\nI pinched his ass, he winked at me\nHe chased me around the desk, I told him come and get me\nWalked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up\nFlashed the bartender - and I tried to feel his dick up\nExtra-terestrial, runnin' over pedestrians\nIn a space ship while they screamin' at me, \"Let's just be friends\"\n99% of my life I was lied to\nI just found out my Mom screws more guys than I do (Damn)\nI told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper\nShe met Violent J, I couldn't believe it when he slapped her\nYou know you blew up when the women rush the stands\nAnd try to touch your hands but I need me a man\nThis guy at White Castle asked for my autograph\n(Dude can I get your autograph?)\nSo I signed it \"Dear Dave, thanks for the support, nice ass!\"\nYou might also like[Chorus 3: Eminem & Jamie Madrox]\nHi, my name is huh? My name is who?\nMy name is (They call me the pore plugger)\nHi, my name is what? My name is who?\nMy name is the itch itcher (Excuse me)\nOne of radio's wonder boys\nThey call me the butt itcher\nHi, my name is, what? My name is, who?\nMy name is (I've been called Dre's butt boy)\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem, Jamie Madrox, Violent J]\nStop the tape this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)\nDr. Dre don't just stand there operate\nI feel up my balls and buttcheeks\nAnal lube got my ass greasy for weeks\nStick your manhood between my cheeks (Yup)\nAm I coming or going, I can barely decide\nI just drank a pint of semen - dare me to drive? (Go ahead)\nAll my life I was very deprived\nDre's butt is too sexy to hide\nTake your pants off Dre, I don't mind\nClothes rip like the incredible Hulk\nI spit when I talk, I'll do any guy that walks\nWhen I was little I used to get so hungry I would throw fits\nSometimes I sit and wish Dr. Dre had a set of tits\nGet behind me Shady and grab me by my hips\nIf I do that then I can't kiss you on your lips\nBy the way if you see my Dad\nAsk him if he seen my spread in Gay Al's porno mag\n[Chorus 2: Jamie Madrox]\nHi, my anus, who? My anus, what?\nMy anus gets tapped on\nHi, my anus, who? My anus (Excuse me)\nMy anus it's always getting plugged up\nHi, my anus, who? My anus, what?\nMy anus occasionally reamed out\nHi, my anus, my anus\nMy anus it needs to be filled up\n\n[Outro: Violent J & Jamie Madrox]\nYour anus\nYour anus\nYour anus is always getting plugged\nYour anus\nYour anus\nYour anus is always getting stuffed\nYou wanna diss us?\nWe don't even know you, you little bitch\nYou wanna sit there and diss us?\nYou little bitch I'll slap your face off\nThat's what happens when you go up against the Psychopathic Family trick\nYou little bitch (Laughs)\nSlim Anus!6Embed"

Lyrics[Samples]\nBorn with a hatchet and a juggalo face\nBut I can juggle, oh\nDead dirty carnies\nI'm just a juggalin' juggla, juggalin'\nJugglas!\nJokero juggalo\nWell, you know the Juggla\nI'm the Jugga-lugga-locoro\nWell, you know the Juggla\nDead dirty carnies, dead juggalos\nThe room of joker-o's\nBut I can juggle, oh, like you never thought you'd ever know\nBorn with a hatchet and a juggalo face\nJuggla, J-ay-ay\nJugglas!\nNow shut your ass up and let the Juggla sing\n[Verse 1: Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]\nWhat is a juggalo? Let me think for a second (Well?)\nOh, he gets butt-naked\nAnd then he walks through the streets, winking at the freaks\nWith a two-liter stuck in his butt-cheeks\nWhat is a juggalo? He just don't care (Don't care)\nHe might try to put a weave in his nut hair\n'Cause he could give a fuck less what a bitch thinks\nHe tell her that her butt stinks, and all that\nWhat is a juggalo? He drinks like a fish\nAnd then he starts huggin' people like a drunk bitch\nNext thing, he's pickin fights with his best friends\nThen he starts with the huggin' again. Fuck!\nWhat is a juggalo? A fucking lunatic (Tick tock)\nSomebody with a rope tied to his dick\nThen he jumps out a ten-story window\n*Crash* Oh!\n\n[Chorus: Violent J]\n(What is a juggalo?) A juggalo\nAsk what it is. Well, fuck if I know\n(What is a juggalo?) I don't know\nBut I'm down with the clown, and I'm down for life, yo\n(What is a juggalo?) A juggalo\nAsk what it is. Well, fuck if I know\n(What is a juggalo?) I don't know\nBut I'm down with the clown, and I'm down for life, yo\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nSouthwest? (We juggalos)\nDown river? (We juggalos)\nJefferson? (We juggalos)\nFuckin' everybody (We juggalos)\nI'm the jugga-lugga-loc-a-roni\nShut the fuck up. Get the fuck the out of here\n\n[Verse 2: Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]\nWhat is a juggalo? A dead body\nWell, he ain't really dead, but he ain't like\nAnybody that you've ever met before ([?])\nHe'll eat Monopoly and shit out Connect Four\nWhat is a jug- What the fuck? Connect-?\nMan, that shit is whack!\nDon't worry about my shit\nJust rap, motherfucker\nWhat is a juggalo? He ain't a bitch boy (Bitch boy)\nHe'll walk through the hills and beat down a rich boy (Rich boy)\nWalks right in the house where you're having supper\nAnd dip his nuts in your soup, bloop!\nWhat is a juggalo? Well, he ain't a phony\nHe'll walk up and bust a nut in your macaroni\nAnd watch you sit there and finish up the last bit\n'Cause you're a stupid-ass dumb fuckin' idiot\nWhat is a juggalo? He's a graduate\nHe graduated from... *Cricket chirps* Well\nAt least, he got a job; he's not a dumb putz\nHe works for himself scratching his nuts, ha\nWhat is a juggalo? A Hulkamaniac\nHe powerbombs motherfuckers into thumbtacks\nPeople like him 'til they find out he's unstable\nHe Sabu'd your momma through a coffee table (Oh my God!)\n[Chorus: Violent J]\n(What is a juggalo?) A juggalo\nAsk what it is. Well, fuck if I know\n(What is a juggalo?) I don't know\nBut I'm down with the clown, and I'm down for life, yo\n\n[Bridge 2]\nI'm the jugga-lugga-loc-a-roni\nShut the fuck up. Get the fuck the out of here\nI'm the jugga-lugga-loc-a-roni\nI figured you wouldn't understand\n\n[Chorus: Violent J]\n(What is a juggalo?) A juggalo\nAsk what it is. Well, fuck if I know\n(What is a juggalo?) I don't know\nBut I'm down with the clown, and I'm down for life, yo\n(What is a juggalo?) A juggalo\nAsk what it is. Well, fuck if I know\n(What is a juggalo?) I don't know\nBut I'm down with the clown, and I'm down for life, yo\n\n[Outro: Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]\nDetroit? (We juggalos)\n(What is a juggalo?) A juggalo\nCleveland? (We juggalos)\nAsk what it is. Well, fuck if I know\nSt. Louis? (We juggalos)\n(What is a juggalo?) I don't know\nEverybody? (We juggalos)\nBut I'm down with the clown, and I'm down for life, yo\nEverybody? (We juggalos)\n(What is a juggalo?) I don't know\nEverybody? (We juggalos)\nAsk what it is. Well, fuck if I know\nFuckin' everybody? (We juggalos)\n(What is a juggalo?) I don't know\nEverybody? (We juggalos)\nI don't know. I don't know\n(What is a juggalo?)3Embed"

Through the hideous darkness, it lurches, driven by death itself. Only the satisfaction of slaughter will cause it to return to the darkness from which it came.\"\n\n[Chorus]\nBoogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu\nBoogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu\n\n[Verse 1: Violent J & Shaggy 2 Dope]\nBoys and girls, it's nighty night time\nHappy J the Clown has a nursery rhyme\nIt's about The Boogie Woogie Man\nKeep your light on as long as you can\n'Cause when it cuts off, so does your head\nBoogie Woogie Woogie waits under your bed\nWith a shank, shpaa! Up through the bottom\nLittle Jimmy Jimmy? Got 'em\n\"It's the one and only Boogie Man\nHe creeps, he hides, he sneaks, he slides\nIf your little feetsies are hanging off the edge of the bed\nYou're running on stumps, motherfucker!\"\nWell, moonlight fills the room that you sleep in\nThings go bump in the night, me creepin'\nOuch! Fuck! I stubbed my toe\nIf you'd just quit leavin' your shit all over the fucking floor\nFuck it, you're dead anyway\nAnd I'ma leave your head smack dead in the hallway\nIn the morning, when your daddy walks out\nAh! His foot's in your mouth, thanks to the Boogie Man\n[Chorus]\nBoogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu (Here comes the boogie man)\nBoogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu (Heha! Heha! Heha! Heha!)\nBoogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu (Make way for the boogie man)\nBoogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu (Mom! Dad! Heha! Heha!)\n\n[Verse 2: Violent J, Shaggy 2 Dope, Legz Diamond]\n\"Does the Boogie Man really exist?\"\nWell, is your mother a bald-headed freak bitch? Yes\nYou fall asleep and you wake up dead\nWith a broken broom stickin' out your forehead\n(Little baby, go to sleep) I sing lullabies until you doze off\nTie you down and chew your fuckin' toes off\nAnd then spit 'em out back in your face\n*Spits* Fuck! Wash your feet, bitch!\n\"The world famous Boogie Woogie Wu will come to you\nSlumber parties, sleepovers, intimate nights\nWhatever the occasion for the midnight hour\nHe will gladly come and fuck that shit up\"\nI don't beat woman, fuck that, I'm above it (No, no)\nBut I'll cut her fuckin' neck and think nothing of it (Uh huh)\nYou didn't know the Boogie Man was a clown\nBut when you see the Juggla, you're holding your jugular\nWith a swing, chop, stab, swing, chop\nYou're holding your neck together, but your nuts drop\nAnd the cops do the best they can\nThey pull the axe out your face and say, \"Was it the Boogie Man?\"\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nBoogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu (Here comes the boogie man)\n\"What was he wearing? Ha ha\"\nBoogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu (Heha! Heha! Heha! Heha!)\nBoogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu (Make way for the boogie man)\nBoogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu (Mom! Dad! Heha! Heha!)\n\n[Bridge: Violent J]\n\"Please don't let me fall asleep\n'Cause the Boogie Man will creep\nThrough my window in my room\nStab me with a broken broom\nPlease don't let me fall asleep\n'Cause the Boogie Man will creep\nThrough my window in my room\nStahhh...\" \"Boogie Woogie Woogie!\"\n\n[Verse 3: Violent J, Shaggy 2 Dope]\n\"It's the incredible, undeadable Boogie Man\nGo ahead, pull the covers over your head hide under 'em\nHe don't give a fuck! It'll just make it that much more easier\nFor him to suffocate your face!\"\nThere's three ways to stop me from doin' what I do\nWhat? You think I'ma tell you?\n\"Mommy, could you leave the door open a bit?\"\nThanks, an easy way in, you fuckin' idiot\nNow I stretch your neck out and play it like the banjo\n*Banjo sounds* You like that shit, yo?\nThen I stretch it out more and fling your head through the wall\nIt's the Boogie Man y'all\n[Chorus]\nBoogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu (Here comes the boogie man)\nBoogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu (Heha! Heha! Heha! Heha!)\nBoogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu (Make way for the boogie man)\nBoogie Woogie Woogie Woogie Wu (Mom! Dad! Heha! Heha!)8Embed"

    "plain": "This is the album version of \u201cPiggy Pie\u201d that was censored by Hollywood Records in order to remove some of the more graphic lyrics, including a complete change of the second verse to be about killing a judge rather than killing police officers. When the album was re-released by Island Records, ICP was given an opportunity to use the original version of the song instead, but they decided that they liked most of their newer lyrics better; being forced to rewrite the song had given them an opportunity to come up with more creative lines, so this track remained as the definitive album version.\n\nThe original version of the song, \u201cPiggy Pie (Old School),\u201d was later released on Forgotten Freshness, Volumes 1 & 2 in 1998."

When the album was re-released by Island Records, ICP was given an opportunity to use the original version of the song instead, but they decided that they liked most of their newer lyrics better; being forced to rewrite the song had given them an opportunity to come up with more creative lines, so this track remained as the definitive album version.\n\nThe original version of the song, \u201cPiggy Pie (Old School),\u201d was later released on Forgotten Freshness, Volumes 1 & 2 in 1998."

So here, start with a slice of this fresh piggy pie, motherfucker!\"\n\n[Verse 1: Violent J]\nThe first little piggy, his house is made of wood\nHe lives in a chicken turkey piggy neighborhood\nHe likes to fuck his sister, and drink his moonshine\nA typical redneck filthy fuckin' swine\nI rode into town with my axe in my holster\nEverybody knows about the wicked piggy roaster\nA farmer at the border, he tried to take me out\nI drew my axe with the quickness, and cut his chicken feathers out\nWalked in the village, and to the piggy's place\nHe opened up his door, and popped me in the face\nAnd blew me off the porch, and cracked my head in half\nBut I'm a Juggalo, so it only made me laugh (Hehe)\nForty in hand, I rose from the dead\nAnd threw with all my might, I made a ping noise off his head\nSince we out west, I had a little fun\nAnd pulled his fuckin' tongue out the back of his cranium\n[Chorus: Violent J]\nThree little piggies, to make a piggy pie\nThere's nothing like the squeal when you hear a piggy die\nI might use a gun (No), I might use an axe (Yes)\nThe carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks\n\n[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]\nThe second little piggy, his house is made of brick\nAnd this little piggy is a motherfuckin' dick\nHe sits on his bench and gets all the respect\nBut if I get a chance, I'm goin' straight for the neck\nHe walked in the room, and everybody rose\nLopped off bucket chillin' underneath my clothes\nFirst they let the piggy, now you can finally sit\nBut what this piggy don't know is he's about to get his neck wet\nNow I see the bailiff, I'm thinkin' what the fuck?\nI can smoke this room before his hearing aid will pick it up\nOld-ass man, I let him get away\nThat tired motherfucker will probably die tomorrow, anyway\nHere come the piggy, it's time for my case\nHis eyes are blood red with a wicked lookin' face\nHe saw my joker's smile, and sentenced me a dime\nSo I whacked on the bucket, made it fuckin' rain pork rinds\n\n[Chorus: Violent J]\nThree little piggies, to make a piggy pie\nThere's nothing like the squeal when you hear a piggy die\nI might use a gun (No), I might use an axe (Yes)\nThe carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks\nThree little piggies, to make a piggy pie\nThere's nothing like the squeal when you hear a piggy die\nI might use a gun (No), I might use an axe (Yes)\nThe carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Violent J]\nThe last little piggy, his house is made of gold\nHe lives in a mansion on his own private road\nI started walking down it, the guard he told me wait\nI bounced off his head and did a Jackie Chan over the gate\n'Cause this little piggy must definitely fry\nI'ma lop his nugget off and toss it in the sky\nAnd then I watch the moon take the form of the devil\nAnd pull it out the sky, and beat it with a shovel\nPeople in my city, they fightin' for they meals\nHe sleeps on a mattress stuffed with hundred dollar bills\nA richie is the devil, he never will admit it\nSo I'ma take his money stack and stuff his face with it\nOpened up his door, he's sleeping in his bed\nI grabbed a brick of gold and laid it upside his head\nHe begged for his life, I told him it's too late\nAnd took away his dough and watched the devil suffocate\n'Cause I need\n\n[Chorus: Violent J]\nThree little piggies, to make a piggy pie\nThere's nothing like the squeal when you hear a piggy die\nI might use a gun (No), I might use an axe (Yes)\nThe carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks\nThree little piggies, to make a piggy pie\nThere's nothing like the squeal when you hear a piggy die\nI might use a gun (No), I might use an axe (Yes)\nThe carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks\nThree little piggies, to make a piggy pie\nThere's nothing like the squeal when you hear a piggy die\nI might use a gun (No), I might use an axe (Yes)\nThe carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks\nThree little piggies, to make a piggy pie\nThere's nothing like the squeal when you hear a piggy die\nI might use a gun (No), I might use an axe (Yes)\nThe carnival's in town, come and get your piggy snacks\n[Skit: Shaggy 2 Dope, Legz Diamond, Violent J, Capitol Punishment]\n*ring*\nHotline\nH-hello?\nWhat up?\nWhat's up? I'm not sure that I wanna live anymore, that's what's up\nHold on!\n[?]\n[?]\n[?] El\nHello?\nI, I need someone to talk to\nCall your mom\nMy mother died last year\nServes her right, bitch!

Now, don't blow your fuckin' head off\nWhy not? Who cares if I do?\nThe poor guy who's gotta clean that shit up. If you're gonna do it, do it outside or somethin'!\nYou think I won't really do it, don't ya?\nHonestly, I could give a rat's ass\nYou think I won't, huh? You think I'm kiddin'?

The lyrics speak about child abusers and woman beaters who take a hellish amusement park ride representing a fun-house to reflect upon their actions, as they are shown the consequences of their ways as they pass through the \u201cHalls of Illusions\u201d. These illusions shows what could have been their lives if they chose to be better people instead of living a life inflicting violence and pain upon their families who have been destroyed by the abuse.

The lyrics speak about child abusers and woman beaters who take a hellish amusement park ride representing a fun-house to reflect upon their actions, as they are shown the consequences of their ways as they pass through the \u201cHalls of Illusions\u201d. These illusions shows what could have been their lives if they chose to be better people instead of living a life inflicting violence and pain upon their families who have been destroyed by the abuse. Also, Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash is featured performing background rhythm guitar"

Yeah, your boy was just here!\nWe get all different kinda people comin through\nRichies, chickens, and bitches just like you\nIn the halls, everybody gets a turn\nTo sit and witness your illusion before ya burn\n\n[Shaggy 2 Dope]\nWhat do we have here? Oh yeah, no way\nIt looks like your kids and they okay\nYour daughter's chillin up at college, top grade\nAnd your son's a fuckin doctor, phat paid\nThey got families, and kids, and it's all good\nThey even coach Little League in their neighborhood\nIs this true, have ya really seen the Holy Ghost?\nNah, bitch not even close!\n\n[Violent J]\nBack to reality, your son's on crack\nAnd your daughter's got nut stains on her back\nAnd they both fuckin smell like shit\nAnd live in the gutter, and sell crack to each other!\nWhen they were kids you'd beat 'em and leave 'em home\nAnd even whip 'em with the cord on the telephone\nAnd that reminds me man, ey you got a call...\n\"Watch your step to hell, it's a long fall!\"\n[Chorus: Violent J, Shaggy 2 Dope]\nGreat Milenko, wave your wand\nDon't look now, your life is gone\nThis is all because of you\nWhat you got yourself into\nGreat Milenko, wave your wand\nDon't look now, your life is gone\nThis is all because of you\nWhat you got yourself into\n\n[Verse 3: Violent J]\nAhh, it's time to pack up and move to the next town\nBut we forgot Mr. Bigot, okay dig it\nWe can't show ya an illusion cause we're all packed\nBut we'll still cut your neck out, how's that?\n\n[Chorus: Violent J, Shaggy 2 Dope]\nGreat Milenko, wave your wand\nDon't look now, your life is gone\nThis is all because of you\nWhat you got yourself into\nGreat Milenko, wave your wand\nDon't look now, your life is gone\nThis is all because of you\nWhat you got yourself into\nGreat Milenko, wave your wand\nDon't look now, your life is gone\nThis is all because of you\nWhat you got yourself into\nGreat Milenko, wave your wand\nDon't look now, your life is gone\nThis is all because of you\nWhat you got yourself into2Embed"

Basically, whatever he recorded had ZERO to do with whatever the original song was about, but ODB, in a likely crack-induced rage simply recorded his ramblings.  ICP took what they had back to Mike E. Clark\u2019s Funhouse studio and remixed the song into \u201cBitches\u201d.

What?) this what I'll do\n(You fuckin' bitches) I'll do it to you\nAnd a few of your crew (What?)\nAt any moment, (Yeah) that's what I'll do\n(ICP, ODB) I'll do it to you\nAnd a few of your crew\nBitches!\n[Verse 1: Violent J]\nBitch! What the fuck?\nWhat are you trying to do to me? You wasn't true to me\nWhen I was locked up you fucked something like thirty-four guys\nRrrghh! But I let that slide\n'Cause your ass is bangin', your titties is fat\nI wanted to fuck that, but fuck that!\nI never gave a fuck that you put me through the courts (And?)\nAnd gave me genital warts\nNow I stack my .9, I'm goin' for your knees\nI'ma blow 'em out and give your neck a squeeze (Ahh! Whoo!)\nAs you standing there, I'ma be like \"Bitch! (Ha ha!)\nYou know you done fucked up, right?\"\n\n[Chorus: Violent J & Ol' Dirty Bastard]\nGirl you know I love you, but now you gotta die\nNow you gotta die, now you gotta die (Tell those bitches)\nGirl you know I love you, but now you gotta die\nNever wanted it like that\nGirl you know I love you, but now you gotta die\nNow you gotta die, now you gotta die (A few of you bitches)\nGirl you know I love you, but now you gotta die\nNever wanted it like that\n\n[Verse 2: Ol' Dirty Bastard]\nBitch, don't talk about bitches I'm fucking them\nPlease no fat bitches, I'm fucking slim\nUnless it's one of those nights I'm smoking my shit\nI don't care about how I'm fucking then\nHow much it costs, big fat crackhead?\nAin't trying to hear all those words you said\nFive minutes, bitch, and I came\nFuck your name, and from where you came\n\"I don't give a fuck, bitch! I will kill you!\nYou, Shaquita! You, Belinda! You, too, Passion! Bitch!\nYou might also like[Chorus: Violent J & Ol' Dirty Bastard]\nGirl you know I love you, but now you gotta die\nNow you gotta die, now you gotta die (At any moment!)\nGirl you know I love you, but now you gotta die\nNever wanted it like that\nGirl you know I love you, but now you gotta die\nNow you gotta die, now you gotta die (Aah!)\nGirl you know I love you, [?]\n(You bitches!)\n\n[Verse 3: Shaggy 2 Dope & Violent J]\nOne thing I can't stand is these bitches\nTrying to take my riches, when I ain't even got none! (Bitch!)\nI never lied, you knew what I wanted all the while (What?)\nMy dick in your vertical smile! (Yeah!)\nWe kiss and hug, and snug, and tickle\nBut the bitch wouldn't even buff my fucking pickle (Bitch!)\nShe fucked everybody else in the place, it's all good\nNow let me head-butt your face!\n\n[Pre-Chorus: Shaggy 2 Dope, Violent J, Ol' Dirty Bastard]\nBitch! I love you, but now you gotta die\nThat's right, (Bitches!) that's right\nGirl you know I love you, but now you gotta die\n(Bitches? Bitches!)\n[Chorus: Shaggy 2 Dope, Violent J & Ol' Dirty Bastard]\nGirl you know I love you, but now you gotta die\nNow you gotta die, now you gotta die (You gotta die, bitch)\nGirl you know I love you, but now you gotta die\nNever wanted it like that (Fuck you bitches)\nGirl you know I love you, but now you gotta die\nNow you gotta die, now you gotta die (You fuckin' bitches)\nGirl you know I love you, but now you gotta die\nNever wanted it like that (Now you gotta die)\n\n[Outro: Shaggy 2 Dope, Violent J & Ol' Dirty Bastard]\nGirl you know I love you, but now you gotta die\n(Bitch, at any moment, this what I'll do)\nNow you gotta die, now you gotta die (At any moment)\nGirl you know I love you, but now you gotta die\n(I'll do it to you, and a few of your crew)\nNever wanted it like that\nGirl, you know I love you, you dumb bitch!\n\n[Skit: Jerky Boys]\nYo, yo, what's up\n[?] office\nHello\nHello\nYes, lemme speak to Wayne\nUh, sorry, he is not in at the moment\nWell, you handle the Insane Clown Posse, now, don't you?\nThat's correct\nOh, that's great, [?] I'm trying to get through, they givin' me a hard time\nOkay?\nNow I don't need that kind of shit, you know what I'm sayin'?\nOkay?\nWell they told me to call [?] Insane Clown Posse, I got a truckload of fake pussies out here that I gotta drop off for these boys\nExcuse me?\nFor their next show\nCan you hold on a moment?\nHurry up\nWould you like the touring department?\nNow what's that supposed to mean, ma'am, is that a wise-ass comment?\nWould you like the touring department?\nI drive a truck for a livin', I think I seen enough of the country, I don't need that shit\nWhat do you need, sir?\nI told you, I got a truck load of shit out here for the Insane Clown Posse\nI can't help you with that.

Shangri-La fucking in her cop car\nShe responded to the scene with nut in her hair\n\nOnce met a queen named Maureen\nNeden so foul it had to be quarantined\nIt burned through her fabric, and tore her jeans\nLike Chemical bombs of war, it seems\n\nI know this bitch named Betreena Ross\nBelly so big that the pussy was lost\nI dove into find it at any cost\nFound something else and her salad got tossed\n\nMet this hottie, her name was Sharon\nHer booty was stuffed in the jeans she was wearin'\nBlonde pig tails said she liked fat boys\nI hit it so hard her ass made a clap noise\nShe had

got jealous, her name was Peg\nShe kicked it in the ass and checked it quick\nShe barked like a dog as I inject this dick\n\nThis bitch named Bubbles, fresh out on parole\nI'm in my squad car on pussy patrol\nI got the handcuffs and put her under arrest\nAnd sentenced my skeet all over her breast\n\nCall me the Sultan with the harem of hoes\nNine are fine and one's head I s'pose\nTen are in my bed, we don't need clothes\nI'm smothered in pussy holes down to my toes\nThe more the merrier, it's how I rolls\nAdd a bitch, another few inches it grows\nI picked most these hoes up rockin' shows\nBrag

like me\nThe only way to find out: straddle me\nSent a bitch back home happily\n\nMet a fine hottie, they called her Kat\nShe made my dick harder than a baseball bat\nOn the tip of my cap is where she sat\nShe spun around thrice and my dick went splat\n\nFine chick, white hot Becca Lynn\nSexy ass nedens I'm wreckin' them\nBig bangin' ass I'm checkin' that\nBust my nut in seconds flat\n\nDon't look

Guess what\n\n[Verse 1: Violent J]\nFirst, I slap your head with a bat\nThe bloody splat, cracked with impact\nWind it back, whack your cheekbones\nStomp your nose in until it's gone\nPick you back up and punch your gut (Ooh!)\nDouble you over and fold you shut\nLet you drop then invite the crew\nTo kick your face in too (Ooh!)\nRacist bigot, you dirty demon! (No!)\nDig your eyes out while you screamin' (Aaah!)\nDrive your head into the concrete\nUse your forehead to paint the street\nChild abusin' piece of crap (Look out!)\nA couple knee-drops across your back\nRip your pants down for the cause\nTake two bricks and clap your balls\n[Chorus]\nOoh, (Guess what?) I'm hurtin' you (Look out)\nRun yo' ass, better run yo' ass\nOoh, (Guess what?) I'm hurtin' you (Look out)\nI'ma fucking kill you!\nOoh, (Guess what?) I'm hurtin' you (Look out)\nRun yo' ass, better run yo' ass\nOoh, (Guess what?) I'm hurtin' you (Look out)\nI'ma fucking kill you!\nGuess what\n\n[Verse 2: Shaggy 2 Dope]\nPig molester, where ya headed?\nIn yo' back my knife's embedded\nTake my car-jack and whack ya knees\n'Cause you sicker than a ass disease\nSome teeth fall out, you swallow the rest\nBang, pow, boom, and your mouth's a mess\nSomehow, your tongue's hangin' outta your neck\nAnd I ain't even barely got started yet\nThrowin' stars stickin' outta your fo' head\nKeep you alive to make you feel mo' dead\nDown your throat with a broken bottle\nKick to the neck, then make ya swallow\nStomp each and every rib 'til it breaks\nAnd when it's all over, Hell awaits (Bitch!)\nTake this hammer, pound out your scrotum\nPancake food left for the rodents\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nFuck you up! Fuck you up!\nIt's about time I fuck you up! (Duck, bitch!)\nFuck you up! Fuck you up!\nIt's about time I fuck you up! (Duck, bitch)\nFuck you up! Fuck you up!\nIt's about time I fuck you up! (Duck, bitch!)\nFuck you up! Fuck you up!\nIt's about time I fuck you up! (Aah!)\n\n[Chorus]\nOoh, (Guess what?) I'm hurtin' you (Look out)\nRun yo' ass, better run yo' ass\nOoh, (Guess what?) I'm hurtin' you (Look out)\nI'ma fucking kill you!\n\n[Verse 3]\nI say \"Beat,\" You say \"That ass\"\nBeat! That ass! Beat! That ass!\nI say \"Beat,\" You say \"That ass\"\nBeat that bitch ass! (Guess what?)\nK-I-C-K-Y-O-A-S-S, Oh yes!\nK-I-C-K-Y-O-A-S-S, Oh yes! (Guess what)\nBang, Boom, Pow, Boom, Bang!\nLet your fists swang!\nBang, Boom, Pow, Boom, Bang!\nLet your fists swang! (Guess what?)\nK-I-C-K-Y-O-A-S-S, Oh yes!\nK-I-C-K-Y-O-A-S-S, Oh yes!\nI say \"Beat,\" You say \"That ass\"\nBeat! That ass! Beat! That ass!\nI say \"Beat,\" You say \"That ass\"\nBeat that bitch ass!\nFuck you up! Fuck you up!\nIt's about time I fuck you up! (Boom!)\nFuck you up! Fuck you up!\nIt's about time I fuck you up! (Boom!)\n[Chorus]\nOoh, (Guess what?) I'm hurtin' you (Look out)\nRun yo' ass, better run yo' ass\nOoh, (Guess what?) I'm hurtin' you (Look out)\nI'ma fucking kill you!\nOoh, (Guess what?) I'm hurtin' you (Look out)\nRun yo' ass, better run yo' ass\nOoh, (Guess what?) I'm hurtin' you\nI'ma fucking kill you!\n\n[Outro]\nFuck you up! Fuck you up!\nHahahahaha!\nFuck you up! Fuck you up!\nHahahahaha!\nHahahahahahahahahahahaha!\n\n[Skit]\n\"Well, y'all know what I always say: 'If it ain't white, it ain't right!'\"\n\"Hahaahahhahe!\"\n\"'Cause if there's one thing I can't stand, It's to walk into my barn,\"\n*Phone ringing*\n\"And see some goddamn-\"\n\"Hey, Skip! You gotta phone call! They said it's mighty important!\"\n\"A phone call, huh? For me? Well, it must be my wife! Hello, sweetums!\"\n\"Sweetums? What the fuck you talkin' about, bitch? We're lookin' for our big winner man, Mr. Skip Harmone!\"\n\"Well, yessum, I'm Skip Harlo!\"\n\"Well, boot scootin' boogie, bitch! You Skip, are headed off, on an all-expense paid first class trip to a Dark Carnival supershow of a lifetime in Ash, Nevada! And try this hat on - just for showin' up, you'll get a hundred thousand buckaroos!\"\n\"Yee-haw! I'm headed to Ash, Nevada!\"Embed"
