No, not yet\nWell lemme know and I'll return to collect\nThey never found me cause Valerie's boy had a different rhythm to play to\nAnd he gon' use his tools to break through\nMindful of the nights in that state, who they say life is what you make it\nWhen really life is what makes you\n[Verse 2: RA Scion]\nPaying homage, with a big nod to Aubrey\nThe schools failed me, thank God the farm taught me\nThe value of a calloused hand, how to work and plow this land\nHow even a modest crop will make your pop the proudest man\nHarvest of a thousand fans, sans a gram of seeds broadcast\nThrough loud speakers, in the weeds I was born last\nProfound effect on my volume, plus the readiness to fill it\nIn the field you should hear what they call 'em\nRegardless I should have spent another year on the bottom tier\nInstead of trynna dodge what it was I thought got 'em here\n89 the number, 84 lumber another summer\nFightin' for cash to mash on the likening\nOf cycles I've seen those not keen on college\nLost direction or went to be correctional officers\nNo opportunity was offered us, I had my sights on\nBeing gone before they cut the lights on, Ryan's song\nRight or wrong, tie it tighter, I'm tired of buying into\nGuidance gone awry, my father fought it with firearms and\nDied in the trauma the violence spawned a child of drama\nNo wonder he's prone to wander, knowing his home is haunted\nPraying that over yonder they still know\nHow much I love 'em I just had to go, had it with the status quo\nThey're asking me if I'll be back when I'm old\nIn fact, no these are my last tracks along Tobacco Road\nBut I'll forever call it home\nAnd I feel it whenever I call home (X4)3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Please\nBreak it, \u2018cause honestly the lie \u201cI try tirelessly\u201d is cowardice\nPowerless am I to fight this avarice, I\u2019m\nDown, to give over control, the soul\u2019s solely yours\nDeal and dispose, but keep it real close but don\u2019t\nBreak it, \u2018cause they gon\u2019 take it hard if I don\u2019t make it through\nAnd some are reaching for reason to hate you\n\nTime and time again I\u2019ve been told\nThat a focus on the flaws of man\u2019s off-center ten-fold\nStricken with the winter cold, sipping the burning hot\nA spill will blister, learn not to leave skin exposed\nStitch it up and pray the kid recover nice\nAnd I might have if not for daddy\u2019s bad advice\nHe\u2019s the type to fight God but not a vice\nGrip the heater twice as hard \u2013 it\u2019s this reality I battle nightly\nEven in sleep it seems flight\u2019s unattainable\nUpon waking the facial expression deigns a satiable exchange\nWeather shades drawn, either side a storm rage on\nPatiently the fawn awaits the day the rain\u2019s gone\nIn my defense I claim it\u2019s obvious I\u2019m not him\nProbably it\u2019s the toxin \u2013 sorry it\u2019s a lot been unresolved\nSick since six, seen \u2018em revolve around a small town\nClique, call it quits \u2013 bring all them walls\nDown, finally I\u2019ma defeat the rival\nWith a rifle, writing my epistle titled \u201ctry cycle,\u201d I\nBreak it, so never they perpetuate the malady\nAbashedly accommodate mortality, undoubtedly I\u2019m\nDown, to reconsider, I\u2019ll stay if you can make a promise though\nPlease keep it real close and don\u2019t\nBreak it\nI'm warning not strong enough to take it now\nAnd I\u2019m investigating other ways out\n\nWe'll rebuild what the bottle destroyed\nI\u2019m downhill standing still at the bottom of Roy\nWhere the pass over 5 look alive much as anything\nCling to the side and any sign of your memory\nMy creative liberty is tempting me to hasten to the point of penance\nWe could be rejoined if you employ forgiveness\nSell it all, tell \u2018em hell is nothing but a cell wall\nI\u2019ma soar even as the shell\u2026 fall\u2026\nDown, shed not a tear for my exodus\nI\u2019m here in the protectorate, the fear I held was delicate, to\nBreak it, simply took a leap of faith and virtue\nServe through, I never meant to hurt you, for certain I\u2019ll be\nDown, to revisit the dearest of my kinfolk\nHold the spirit near, keep it real close but don\u2019t\nBreak it, the creed is all we got until we meet again\nI pray you gon\u2019 make it through the season4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

   "lyrics": "(RA Scion)\nAnd if you got one, love one\u2026\nYou\u2019re lucky just to have just one\u2026\n\n(Ra Scion)\nOne mother, one sister, one daughter, one wife\nOnce lost in the darkness; blessed by sunlight\nOnce blind to the bounties of livin\u2019 \u2013 Lord, surround me with four women\nTo symbolize life; I\u2019m born twice\nFor forty days and nights weathered the storm\u2019s tug\nMy mother\u2019s fear of the water taught me how to swim above\nI fought waves as she prayed and never gave up\nHer faith saved me, and I just wanna say \u201cthank you for your love\u2026\u201d\n\n(Ra Scion)\nMy memories of childhood are like dreams\nI\u2019m a drifter \u2013 thinkin\u2019 of my sister\u2019s like scenes\nOf a movie; me screamin\u2019 \u201cyou\u2019re not my mom,\u201d set to swing\nYou holdin\u2019 me yellin\u2019 to me \u201cI\u2019m the next best thing\u201d\nSix years of separation\u2019s damn near a generation\nBut you never stopped trying to understand my motivation\nAnd you always had my back when push came to shove\nWe\u2019re the same blood, through the rain\u2019s floods \u2013 \u201cthank you for your love\u201d\n\n(Ra Scion)\nI\u2019ve said it before, I\u2019ll say it to my death\nI will never fully comprehend just why God left you\nIn my hands, when I could hardly stand, I guess\nIt was significant that you and I would take our first steps\nIn stride \u2013 me as a follower, you as a guide\nRevealer of the way as you explain I play the scribe\nLeader of the tribe \u2013 reason that Abeo came alive\nMy name, my pride, I take time to \u201cthank you for your love\u201d\n(Ra Scion)\nWho would have ever thought we\u2019d come this far?\nTwo renegades who finally made their way to the stars\nBuilt a bridge over the river of doubt and made \u201csound\u201d\nThe foundation on which we would build this house\nAnd ain't that what matrimony\u2019s about; a shared vision?\nWe draw on the strengths of intellect and intuition\nYou\u2019re the symbolism of liberated women, the definition of\nWhat a companion does \u2013 \u201cthank you for your love\u201d\n\n(Ra Scion)\nThank you all for your support in my times of need\nYour belief in me empowers me to lead\nAnd they wonder how I stand this firm to transgressions\nY\u2019all taught to me the lessons every man must learn\nMother showed me how to fold my hands and thank God\nThrough my sister\u2019s eyes \u2013 compromise was not hard\nMy daughter teaches me honesty and honestly\nMy wife teaches love for my mother, now my cipher\u2019s complete\n(That\u2019s one love\u2026)\n\n(Ra Scion)\nOne mother, one sister, one daughter, one wife\nOnce lost in the darkness; blessed by sunlight\nOnce blind to the bounties of livin\u2019 \u2013 Lord, surround me with four women\nTo symbolize life; I\u2019m born twice\nAnd lucky enough to have known a love like this\nMy dedication \u2013 the inspiration to write this\nWe\u2019re consolidatin\u2019 the family ties \u2013 we\u2019re drawn tight\nKnowin\u2019 things are gonna be alright..EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

    "plain": "\u201cEscaping Arkham\u201d is the conclusion of RA Scion\u2019s two-part reflection on tests of faith and suicide.  Part one is revealed in \u201cWinter Takes All,\u201d which tells the story of a man of faith battling depression who contemplates suicide and ultimately takes his own life by jumping from a bridge.  \u201cEscaping Arkham\u201d picks up where \u201cWinter Takes All\u201d leaves off, at the exact moment the man jumps.  In an interview with Seeds Entertainment, RA Scion explained that:\n\nAt the end of \u201cWinter Takes All\u201d the main character has battled all these things in the past and he finally resigned himself to freeing himself until he jumps and then \u201cEscaping Arkham\u201d is about the moment between the physical jump and death.

Part one is revealed in \u201cWinter Takes All,\u201d which tells the story of a man of faith battling depression who contemplates suicide and ultimately takes his own life by jumping from a bridge.  \u201cEscaping Arkham\u201d picks up where \u201cWinter Takes All\u201d leaves off, at the exact moment the man jumps.  In an interview with Seeds Entertainment, RA Scion explained that:\n\nAt the end of \u201cWinter Takes All\u201d the main character has battled all these things in the past and he finally resigned himself to freeing himself until he jumps and then \u201cEscaping Arkham\u201d is about the moment between the physical jump and death. The whole second verse talks about levitating and hovering, it\u2019s actually describing when the subject jumps off of the bridge."

    "plain": "This song is about the current state of the mainstream hip hop community. He calls out many of the problems in the community today such as selling out, preaching poor messages, and doing anything just to make money. He talks about countering this method with his own method, by speaking truth, spreading the truth freely to anyone who will listen, and helping others first instead of yourself. Read deeply into this song, it holds so much truth and power"

He calls out many of the problems in the community today such as selling out, preaching poor messages, and doing anything just to make money. He talks about countering this method with his own method, by speaking truth, spreading the truth freely to anyone who will listen, and helping others first instead of yourself. Read deeply into this song, it holds so much truth and power"

I'mma have to cut you off\u0085\nVerse 3\n\nHome is where the hatred is - gray skies play tricks on minds\nThat try to escape from this\nDirty shades of monochrome - 30 days since the sun last shone\nWhen seeds leave, they come back grown\nStiflin' is rife - signs of early life abound\nThen it's - \u0093cut 'em down, cut 'em cut'em down!!\u0094\nYour whole tribe subscribe to that Weyerhauser mentality\nWhere one tree replaced by three is mathematically sound\nSo while you're busy diggin' holes in the ground\nThey're back at the factory makin' paper\nI'm hip to the game and it's a shame y'all recyclin' goods\nSince childhood I've been lightin' the woods aflame\nRid the 'old growth' and let the ash fertilize it - naturally\nSuch a beautiful catastrophe\nAsk me and I'mma tell you 'burn 'em all' then graft me\nTo the last free-standin' piece of charred, black tree\nI'mma refurbish the earth with the majesty\nCause home is where the heart has to be (say what?)\nI'mma refurbish the earth with the majesty\nCause home is where the heart has to be\u0085EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Heaven only knows, though he's\nHopeful, never boastful about the ethic\nSet it deep into the earth, work and serve, all the rest let it\nCome or not, hot summer sun, son bumper crop\nOver night, or so some thought (now they're talkin' that)\n\nWhat you really did to get this windfall, spendin' all year estranged?\nBetter not be mystical, typically the criminals here they hang\nAin't nobody ever seen you cultivate, rake or till, ya dig?\nTake a lot to win a pot, wanna pay the rate? The stakes raised, you bid?\nIn or out, what the men around here bout, finna count a pound of cheese\nDouble down, you intend to win the prize, otherwise bounce and leave\nWe don't care where you came from, since day one seen the game constructed\nWe gon' watch it all fall, frauds claim to save it in the name of love? Nuh uh\n\n[Hook 1: RA Scion]\nBubble, fizz what the trouble is?\nThis is hustle biz what the trouble is?\nA couple kids what the trouble is?\nMuzzle ripped, tell em what the trouble is, come on now\n[Hook]\nTrouble is love don't want you, boy, see the\nTrouble is love don't want you, baby, see the\nTrouble is love don't want you, no, see the\nTrouble is love don't want you here\n\n[Verse 2: RA Scion]\nNot one to gamble, lit the Camel, took a long drag\nSat back and blew, inside he knew these folks had gone mad\nThrough the smoke proposed a wager: tails, you can take my fields\nHeads, you accept my station; they deliberated, deal!\nCoin turned for what seemed like eternity, slow breath\nSome folks wept and fretted while the peasant never broke a sweat\nConfident he had em in the talisman's descent\nBy the time they shouted TAILS, he done packed his bags and went\n\nBest never try to test the vets, you wanna settle? Better pay your dues\nTo the boss you done lost your crops, in one toss I'll take your food\nBetter be gone, set about and keep on a boulevard towards the boat\nEver come back get about a ton of that d-CON down your throat\nIn the meantime we find these fine fruits do quench a thirst\nAnd for pay we may persuade and convince some of these men to work\nIn the end we sup and supplement the income caught in the trap\nWe must be blessed, best of all that farmer's gone, thank God for that\n\n[Hook 2: RA Scion]\nDouble-dipped what the trouble is?\nThat's hustle biz what the trouble is?\nA couple kids what the trouble is?\nKnuckle, fist, tell em what the trouble is, come on now\n[Hook]\nTrouble is love don't want you, boy, see the\nTrouble is love don't want you, baby, see the\nTrouble is love don't want you, no, see the\nTrouble is love don't want you here1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Let women decide\nFor men will ever judge from within this\nMinute in time, and the standard I\u2019m held to is\nFrom another planet, I landed here when mine fell through\nAlienated by no paleontological ties\nBut never is this kid discredited by the honorable\nAll rise, son \u2013 the sun presides, the abominable\nFind it comical I call my shine beyond nominal, uh\nMy handle fine-tuned to channel 19\nAddress my living letters, better left unsigned\nThough punctual, no wonder you\u2019re some kind of comfortable\nStomach full of lunch-line chuck and junk food\nEmpty calories will soon catch up, comments are\nCovered in condiments, son it must have been my fat gene\u2019s dominant\nCommon represents the conjugate that heaven sent to compliment\nThe veteran\u2019s accomplishment, the conscious honor it, but\n\nWhispers of them do us like we\u2019re disingenuous, like\nYou only rock it for the paper that\u2019s thrown\nAs if this is an end to my condition of indigence\nNah, we holding stock in something sacred as stone\nSo when victims of insolence rise above the influence\nI open the flock to those who made it alone\nIt\u2019s the mission of men who just write despite ignorance\nYo, with swollen pockets we gon\u2019 take it back home\n[SCRATCH HOOK]\n\nThis goes out to all my people in the city (repeated)\nWhere we don\u2019t get caught up in between with the nonsense\nThis goes out to all my people in the city (repeated)\nNever worrying about grief\n\nDefine your residence, if these 4 walls simply shelter you from elements\nI recommend you get out more\nOff base you face a down pour, catch a taste of what the\nTown\u2019s renowned for, these spates will drown y\u2019all\nSlick and precipitous, I\u2019m bloodied up, to the\nCity of Brotherly Love, 206 is the antithesis\nMy tolerance is type ridiculous, though I\nContinuously seek forgiveness for the shit I wished upon you\nA disservice to mom dukes \u2013 she raised me better\nFor her baby, set a greater precedent to gauge and measure success\nAnd I know she will never love me no less\nBut you sycophants are sick, ugly and grotesque\nI\u2019m amongst the monstrous who breathe fire out the nostrils\nAkin to conquerors you read about in the gospels\nInhospitable are the Pontius, Pilate the prefect\nThese Sea-dwelling fellas ain't accepted me yet\n\nSo I stay on my biz and if he play the periphery he\nControl the block around the space them cats own\nI see this state of misery as the greatest gift to me, yo\nMy golden op will be escaping that drone\nSee I\u2019m a late epiphany, uh, away from mendicancy\nI told \u2018em stop it, son \u2013 don\u2019t wait for that loan\nI heard they say it\u2019s trickery, but we\u2019re making history\nYo, with swollen pockets we gon\u2019 take it back home\n[SCRATCH HOOK]2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Summer breeze, fair wind\nJasmine ain't blowin\u2019 their minds, they\u2019re smokin\u2019 heroin\nNo we don\u2019t select the listenership or bend to it\nThe insurrection intimate and interests the syndicate\nOffense of friends, incidental to my requisition\nIn the end, I respect your decision2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Turn! Turn!\u201d The Bible passage focused on how the human condition is one defined by changing seasons of circumstance. Some days, you want to run, and other days, you have to stay put.\n\nIn this song, RA Scion meditates on perhaps returning to Common Market, out of an understanding that other people need his perspective to grow themselves."

I know\nI'm breathin' deeper there's people needin' me here. Come on\nI'm breathin\u2019 deeper there\u2019s people needin' me here. Fo sho\n\n\nYeah, came to reclaim it when it stole\nMotivated by redemption cleansin\u2019 of the sinner soul, so\nSo appropriately situated adjacent to Mecca\nMy faith and fate hang in the balance of weighted measure\nThe metrics of archetypal relics, dated ritual\nSkillfully the wizard willed away at the original will come again\nSon of the son, sun and summer when\nBreeze refresh and we'll show 'em we see the sufferin' as evident\nLet\u2019s throw this hope on the necessitous\nStep inside the set to try and resurrect the requisite\nPerspective is effectively essential to the mission\nMake 'em in dependable individuals with infinite capacity for critical analyses\nMost valuable abound the valleys and the mountain peaks\nBoth rode this emotional roller coaster from an isle in the kings to fight in these high seas\nIve been strivin' to breathe, dyin' to free the lion inside of me\nIt might be time to revive RA Scion and Sabzi\nI'll be obviously inspired by these old beats, yeah\nAnd y'all be askin' bout the old me, yeah\nCame to reclaim it when it stole\nMotivated by redemption cleansin' of the sinner soul\nYo, find me toward the light with a wing and prayer\nI've been too tired to fight and on the brink of despair\nJust a few more nights until a new season of pear scented spring in the air\nI'm breathin' deeper there's people needin' me here. I know\nI'm breathin' deeper there's people needin' me here. Come on\n\nSo appropriately made in the mold of Medusa\nMy momma, lenny and [?] cemented a myth of whose future was this\nA dudes images imprintin' in glyphs\nTestament to my dominion\nWhy I riff, why I riff\nRepetition of this iddy[?] elect kept the kinetic\nRelay the message, observe us to the ethic\nWe definitely blesseded to get even a second\nJust to be present and what isn't that's just the greatest day\nI waded my way into the waves the became afraid\nTook a little more than 40 days for the grey to fade\nRole played a soldier realized I ain't a game of hate\nIt's cool, the rules always seeming to change anyway\nI disarmed in a gaze, started studying my lines while they setting the stage\nI say why waste time stressin' over the messes you made\nWe gonna pay a penance at the end of this pegasus [?] no doubt\n\nYo, find me toward the light with a wing and prayer\nI've been too tired to fight and on the brink of despair\nJust a few more nights until a new season of pear scented spring in the air\nI'm breathin' deeper there's people needin' me here. I know\nI'm breathin' deeper there's people needin' me here. Come on\nI'm breathin' deeper there's people needin' me here. Fo sho\nYo it's a time to build up\nA time to break down\nA time to escape\nAnd it's a time to stay around\nA time to laugh and dance and weep and mourn and cry and die and time to be reborn\nSo rise up and come on\n\nRise up and come on\nRock wid us, yeah3EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

   "lyrics": "[Introduction]\n\n\n[ Verse 1]\nTo fallen comrades, all I have to offer is this\nWord of insignificance: y\u2019all really been missed\nSome soldiers never enlist but find themselves\nEngaged in conflict where it\u2019s life\u2019s stakes, regardless\nAin't nothin' promised from the minute we started\nStill it\u2019s hard feelin\u2019 you wasn\u2019t robbed of any part\nEvery bar penned in your memory\u2019s honor, my intercession\nI struggle to keep the faith, I\u2019m bereft of possession\nWhat\u2019s left then, of this pathetic relic I stepped in?\nThe cut through the core may have severed my last connection\nI\u2019m expectin\u2019 a sign of acceptance, tethered to the axiom\nInadequate reception, I reckon it\u2019s from the valium\nA stepson of the pallium challenge and test one\nNebulous response said \"It\u2019s better not to question\"\nIn rejection of your slant, I\u2019m demanding an explanation\nWhere\u2019s the justice or the justification in takin\u2019 Nathan?\nBrother you listenin\u2019? Send the exposition\nI\u2019m sick of pretending there\u2019s any intent to my existence\nI\u2019mma lie beneath the Woodbine, lookin\u2019 for a sign\nIf you could find (one) - right about now\u2019d be a good time\n\n[Chorus]\nI had a dream this morning\nThat the rain came pourin\u2019, better vacate the warren, and I\nI\u2019ve never seen such mournin\u2019\nIn the wake of a storm better wake up the warden, and I\nBeg you to heed this warnin\u2019\nFor the sake of the pure and I\u2019mma wait here for \u2018em\nWe gotta leave these quarters\nAnd escape what\u2019s in store, either face fate or break, y\u2019all\n[Verse 2]\nA straggling of peers in the academy\nAre lookin\u2019 at me like \"You said to move, start traveling!\"\nA captain with no navigating skills in the galley\nFightin\u2019 to flee the feral at the peril of the menagerie\nWithin the waves (I) start waverin\u2019\nWhere\u2019s this revelation when the frame comes cavin\u2019 in?\nGrave thoughts: \"Where they \u2019bout to put mine?\" if you\nOverlook a crime - right about now\u2019d be a good time\n\n[Verse 3]\nIt\u2019s a long reach into vast space\nLately I been slashed, maybe you could meet me halfway\nDays passed since I got the cache tatted\nI\u2019m a fast player with the match and paper in the ashtray\nTold when I asked that the pathway is wide, though\nAccommodatin\u2019 all cats attracted to the fire\u2019s glow\nTough as it was I let my pride go - something said to\nTrust, but it\u2019s nothing left inside to revive, over\nThin books of laws we found cause for discord\nAnd distort every bit of wisdom it give forth\nQuick to stir it up and settle shit with a fist Lord\nThey\u2019d be afraid of death if they had something to live for\nThe orb in the distance shone for the lone canoness\nGrantin\u2019 \u2018em amnesty for tamperin\u2019 with the manifest\nMy mannerism: a prism and should shine; light it if you would\nBe so kind - right now\u2019d be a good time\n[Chorus]\n\n[Verse 4]\nI\u2019m tryin\u2019 not to feel responsible\nFor complicating things in relation to the chronicle\nYou\u2019re free to walk away, for you to stay seems improbable\nIf I led you astray I pray to suffer the unconscionable\nBut if (there's) truth therein, drop the\nAnchor deep and save me, thankfully your bravery\nWithstood mine, shook in the waves, but it looks fine\nGive praise - right about now\u2019d be a good timeEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Because of y'all's hang up's?\nDead the jealousy and step your PR game up\nAs if I never offered even dialog, called a dozen\nMeetings at the Beacon branch - people can't speak\nIn retrospect I hold regret over the whole\nSeparation and representation of sets, bet I'm\nDedicated to my record label, pledge stated ages back\nA few viewed the move as exclusive, my dude I hated that\nAin't nothin' changed, got a name plus a sharper aim\nMarket share, the common denominator remain\nTo the Line and to the thine own self, try to be true\nGet down and organize and keep it real for your crew\nCHORUS2EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

    "plain": "This is just an amazing flow. The theme is classic David and Goliath. The lyrics are layered and cryptic and admit of multiple associations. Youthful warrior instinct coming from a \u201cbastard\u201d with the blood but missing the birthright, he \u201csoldiers\u201d on in the cause of destruction of oppressive structures, heart pure and back bowed in effort and labor. Reminiscent of Rush themes. This song attracts and inspires me greatly and captures the best spirit of the youthful moral warrior on the side of the weak and keeping the self humble all the while. Great imagery. It has to be more than a bit analogous to my bio, fitting as my middle name \u201cFitzgerald\u201d meaning \u201cbastard son of royalty.\u201d I don\u2019t see this lyric as self-aggrandizing in any way\u2013he throws his lot in with the people even while he is perfectly capable of solitary striving for long periods. The traces of bravado are put to good use and assistance is sought during weak moments. Just a gem of a song."

       "plain": "This is just an amazing flow. The theme is classic David and Goliath. The lyrics are layered and cryptic and admit of multiple associations. Youthful warrior instinct coming from a \u201cbastard\u201d with the blood but missing the birthright, he \u201csoldiers\u201d on in the cause of destruction of oppressive structures, heart pure and back bowed in effort and labor. Reminiscent of Rush themes. This song attracts and inspires me greatly and captures the best spirit of the youthful moral warrior on the side of the weak and keeping the self humble all the while. Great imagery. It has to be more than a bit analogous to my bio, fitting as my middle name \u201cFitzgerald\u201d meaning \u201cbastard son of royalty.\u201d I don\u2019t see this lyric as self-aggrandizing in any way\u2013he throws his lot in with the people even while he is perfectly capable of solitary striving for long periods. The traces of bravado are put to good use and assistance is sought during weak moments. Just a gem of a song."

This is it, y'all \u2013 people unite and say what?\nEvery Last One of Us!EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

Never asked\nMany mysteries will be revealed through the devil's craft\nI'm a fast study, barn burner, the charm turnin'\nUgly under sparks when sharpening up the cutlery\nSkill a little rusty but trust me, I'mma resuscitate\nThis call is hard to kill off once it culminates\nHibernation, my obligation is contractual\nWhere have all the good men gone? They're on sabbatical\nBaptizing my goddaughter, water wash the hands of blood\nBut soles soiled with the sand and mud\nFor the love of them rise above and cleanse the sins\nI can part with that much, just don't touch the timbs\nEvery scuff I earned, armchair sucker-tough, I yearn\nTo compare it to the stuff I learned\nColonel status 'til the graduate passed on, the pursuit of\nPassion will stop upon a plot on Vashon\nNice one, boy - the soy that's on the upper row\nPrice one; that's a bison, not a buffalo\nHustle grand, seen a demand for organic\nIn toxicity limits - infinitely more panic\nThey're resorting to importing plants from other planets\nIt cancels out the importance of the advantage\nThey're tantric types - neophytes with dietary afflictions\nImposing proprietary restrictions\nTime to go to war, shortly I'll be back in Drennon\nAttending to 40 acres and a dissident\u0085EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

(X2)\n\nSharin' hymns with the seraphims \u2013 praise in polyphonic\n\nFashion\nThe action reanimates the catatonic\nAid the abject and abjure the apathetic\nPositive polarity and the draw is magnetic\nThey lurch and reel trynna reverse the field but can't\nManage\nThe pull of my sign aligns planets\nSecrets comin' out in the wash of the ebb tide\nThose who sought found; those who fled died\nTo the sight deprived sound might provide solace\nThe scholars of applied sciences supply the knowledge\nUpon the foundation we erect the edifice \u2013 make it\nKnown\nWe dedicate the corner stone to Aeschylus\nFortified with more than 45's \u2013 master the art of war\nYou blast trouble, but the struggle endures\nEmaciated, the contemplative will kill for a drink\nIf not methodically restrained by the chain link\nFrom my solid form I liquefy to be absorbed by the\nRiver\nStand re-delivered to mi amour\nChant \"freedom\" in their face and abase my captors\nWith grace I placate and await the rapture\nIn this colony I've seen atrocities personified\nStill unable to affect the sovereignty of the allied\nIt's the balance \u2013 they're challengin' your will to\nAchieve\nImprison my coalition but the vision's still free...\nHe had to have been born that way\nA great many show envy towards the Lord's proteg\u00e8\nAnd maybe if you pay for it he'll perform a display\nOr maybe \u2013 maybe you're too late...

Time to bring y'all in\nI turn a king to a thrall of the pen\nAnd what the team scrawl then is about to bring y'all in\n\nScent of my magnetism is animalistic\nLuck of the nothin' \u2013 tug of the draw's pan-pacific, kid\nKnuckle and brawl and handle your business\nSparring with a phantom is tantamount to dancin' \u2013 rhythm deficient\nOfficially minted, leave a critic to speculate\nIf you're the next great, where's the hint of pimp in your gait\nStrode steady for years, still standin' after my appearance here\nStabilize my saber, the spearmint spear\nFull flavor to spare, sip it with a modicum of self-restraint\nSelf-proclaimed prophets have felt faint\nShell of a saint yellin' devilish thangs in their harangue\nThis fella claims the spirit is spent? Tell him it ain't\nFrom ashes arise a Lazarus to gather them back\nBabbling pragmatists and satirists are lathered in flack\nTapping the pattern out: dit-dot-dash in mathematics\nThe path of a maverick and through rap, you track the half of it\nDesignated with asterisks, the last hall of famer\nInducted before the regulations changed in your favor\nI ain't mad atcha \u2013 a waste of anger to hate ya\nSave my words to determine the fate of the nomenclature\nWho's sayin' preservation's makin' it stagnate advancement?\nState your place and I'mma wait for your answer\nThey prolly just hope to aggravate the populous\nI tabulate the coiffeurs when the pull make 'em gravitate\nEverything gets resolved I attend [to]\nEither fiend or friend \u2013 we gon' bring y'all in\nThe kid dream in the drawl of his kin\nWhat I seen appall men \u2013 time to bring y'all in\nIntervene, my involvement depends\nOn the steam awe lends \u2013 enough to bring y'all in\nI felt the sting when swallowin' the gin\nHolla \"clean I been\" after we bring y'all in\n\nAssault the sire, y'all admire my moxie\nSome aligned with the code of the streets by proxy\nKnockin' me for constancy I be within my element\nThough all you ever held and dealt was leant from a twelve-inch\nThe blend's off \u2013 pitch it right, livin' like a bitch of my mentors?\nWhen vinyl's all you're spinnin' on Crenshaw\nSense flawed and faulty, your censure tawdry\nI alike derived my philosophy from who taught me, let 'em talk now\nImpossible shot from a broken arrow\nSun lay over death, you left prints on the tarot\nI'll show you how to tow the harrow over the tract\nIt's slow-going with all the work my barrow packs\nSkirt past, cursin' at us claiming the lanes are for these\nI pay no mind to idle talk, y'all a mockery of speed\nI pace the beat patiently, as long as it takes\nAcquiesce to the greatest escape (here we go)\nTo every being ever called up to spend\nJust a blink 'fore it ends \u2013 we gon' bring y'all in\nA couple cling to the wall they defend\nEither sink or swim \u2013 we gon' bring y'all in\nBaby string can't haul them gems\nYou trynna ring all ten?
