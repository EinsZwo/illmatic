  "plain": "Hailing from the frozen tundra of Minnesota, better known for its pop idols and drunk rockers, Atmosphere is a rap duo who \u201cput Minneapolis Hip Hop on the map\u201d.\n\nOriginally, a collective of Minnesota rappers and beatmakers known as Headshots made mixtapes of their music that they gave away for free. By 1997, the collective had been reduced to Sean \u201cSlug\u201d Daley,  Brent \u201cSiddiq\u201d Sayers, Anthony \u201cAnt\u201d Davis, Derek \u201cSpawn\u201d Turner and Musab \u201cBeyond\u201d Saad who began to focus on the \u201cimportant shit\u201d necessary to creating a successful music business. Siddiq stopped making beats to focus on managing Rhymesayers Entertainment (RSE) \u2013  a company that would eventually become \u201cthe Twin Cities' biggest record label\u201d.\n\nTouring anywhere for anyone for any price combined with connecting with fans using an early presence on the Internet allowed Atmosphere, at the time a trio of Slug, Spawn & Ant, to grow a following without radio play, MTV exposure or having their albums in stores. Spawn left the group for personal reasons around the time Atmosphere\u2019s first album Overcast was released.\n\nOver the next five years, Atmosphere collaborated with Dynospectrum and Deep Puddle Dynamics, and released several of their own EPs along with the cassette-only Headshots: Se7en. In 2002, Atmosphere dropped GodLovesUgly and it sold 13,000 copies in its first week, leading to a number of major labels (unsuccessfully) courting the duo. It appeared on the Billboard 200 and its single \u201cModern Man\u2019s Hustle\u201d remains Atmosphere\u2019s only top 20 on Billboard\u2019s Rap Chart.\n\nThree months before the band released Seven\u2019s Travels, a 16-year old female fan was raped and murdered by a recently paroled janitor who worked at the venue where Atmosphere was performing \u2013 an event that would not only inspire a change of cover art for the album, but also a change in Slug who would \u201ctransition to try to be a more responsible artist not just to the audience but to myself\u201d. Seven\u2019s Travels became Atmosphere\u2019s first of several consecutive albums to peak in the top half of The Billboard 200.\n\nAfter re-releasing Headshots: Se7en in early 2005, Atmosphere\u2019s fourth studio album You Can\u2019t Imagine How Much Fun We\u2019re Having followed later that year. While working on their fifth album over the next few years, the band\u2019s output of surplus material was massive. Four \u2018Sad Clown\u2019 EPs and the free album Strictly Leakage preceded 2008\u2019s critically-acclaimed When Life Gives You Lemons, You Paint That Shit Gold \u2013 an album that remains their highest charting, reaching #5. It spawned a minor alternative radio crossover hit with \u201cYou\u201d. In the years leading up to Lemons, the band had begun sampling live instruments instead of using music from other artists, and also started performing as a band with members playing instruments live alongside Ant\u2019s DJ'ing and backing tracks.\n\nMore EPs followed with 2009\u2019s free Leak At Will and a 2010 \u2018double EP\u2019 titled To All My Friends, Blood Makes The Blade Holy. Next, The Family Sign, Southsiders and Fishing Blues offered more of the group\u2019s introspective lyrics over further efforts to give hip hop a more mature sound. All three albums (and the preceding double EP) reached the top 40 on Billboard\u2019s Albums Chart. Since 2018, their releases have not achieved the same chart success the duo had experienced earlier."

Looked just like you\nStrange things my imagination might do\nTake a breath, reflect on what we've been through\nOr am I just going crazy \u2018cause I miss you?\nYesterday, was that you? Looked just like you\nStrange things my imagination might do\nTake a breath, reflect on what we've been through\nOr am I just going crazy \u2018cause I miss you?\n\n[Verse 2]\nI'm shook, I know I pushed when I should have pulled\nTook it all back if I could, I put that on my soul\nAnd I would make a top notch good listener\nIf you could block off a little time out to give it here\nSince we went our separate paths\nI've hit a couple of snags that remind me of the past\nI can't front, I'm having a blast\nBut damned if I ain't afraid of how long it's gonna last\nSitting here wishing we could kick it\nGive me your opinions, I do miss the criticisms\nI didn't mean to be distant, make a visit\nI'll wait up and keep the coffee brewing in the kitchen\nBut who am I jokin' with?\nThere's no way that you and I will ever get to re-open it\nIt doesn't matter, this is more than love\nAnd maybe if I'm lucky, get to see you out the corner of\u2026\n[Chorus]\nYesterday, was that you? Looked just like you\nStrange things my imagination might do\nTake a breath, reflect on what we've been through\nOr am I just going crazy \u2018cause I miss you?\nYesterday, was that you? Looked just like you\nStrange things my imagination might do\nTake a breath, reflect on what we've been through\nOr am I just going crazy \u2018cause I miss you?\n\n[Verse 3]\nAnd when you left, I didn't see it coming\nI guess I slept, it ain't like you was running\nYou crept out the front door slow\nAnd I was so self-absorbed I didn't even know\nAnd by the the time I looked up, it was booked up\nPut it all behind you, the bad and the good stuff\nA whole house full of dreams and steps\nI think you'd be impressed with the pieces I kept\nYou disappeared, but the history is still here\nThat's why I try not to cry over spilt beer\nI can't even get mad that you're gone\nLeaving me was probably the best thing you ever taught me\nI'm sorry, it's official\nI was a fistful, I didn't keep it simple\nChip on the shoulder, anger in my veins\nHad so much hatred now it brings me shame\nNever thought about the world without you\nAnd I promise that I'll never say another bad word about you\nI thought I saw you yesterday\nBut I know it wasn't you, \u2018cause you passed away, Dad\n[Chorus]\nLooked just like you\nStrange things my imagination might do\nTake a breath, reflect on what we've been through\nOr am I just going crazy \u2018cause I miss you?51Embed"

You know he's... He might come out.\"\n\"Left you standing in the rain all wet.\"\n\"Wait, I just wanna say...\"\n\"No, no, who are you waiting for?\"\n\"A guy I met at the show.\"\n\"Who, Slug? You're waiting for fucking Slug?\"\n\"No! I mean no, uhh, yeah.\"\n\"Oh no, you're... You're fucking kidding me.\"\n\"He's so hot.\"\n(unintelligable)\n\"Fucking Slug? Oh my God, he is so fucking ugly.\"\n[Verse 1]\nI wear my scars like the rings on a pimp\nI live life like the captain of a sinking ship\nThe one thing that I can guarantee\nI'm like a stepping razor, I suggest you stay fair with me\nBeen paying dues for a decade plus\nBefore that I was just another face on the bus\nTappin' my foot, to the beat on the radio\nDreaming 'bout the mic and the money and the ladies\nOh mom, I promise I'm gonna be large\nSome day I'ma stop trying to borrow your car\nGonna go far, with charisma and skill\nUntil they put my face on a million dollar bill\nAtmosphere, it's just a ten letter word\nDiscretion is the name of my cement-feathered bird\nAnd if you didn't hear, then fuck what others heard\nI think you got the sickness, I suggest you get it cured\nCaught up in the mix of a bottle full of fix\nI'mma hobble down the street till I reach Knob Creek\nIt's not that I don't like you, I just don't want to speak\nYou fucking freak, now keep your days out my week\nThe world keeps a balance, through mathematics\nDefined by whatever you've added and subtracted\nI'm pushin' on the hammer to trigger the brain\nEmbrace how I live, 'cause God loves ugly\n[Chorus]\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\n\n[Verse 2]\nOnce upon a time in Minneapolis, yo\nI damn near had to steal the show\nI stepped on the stage - \"Who is it?\"\nMy name's Slug, I've come to kill a couple minutes\nAnd what's up with the way that everybody gathers around\nEach other, so they can steal each others' sound\nIf it's all about getting down, with the get down\nHow long I gotta wait for these fools to sit down?\nAppears more clear in its simplest form\nNobody sees tears when you're standin' in the storm\nAbandonin' the norm, and handlin' the harvest\nMeasurin' the worth by the depth of the hardship\nI welcome all the hatred you can aim at my name\nI held onto the sacred ways of how to play the game\nWhen the soldiers started runnin' short on rations\nI began tappin' the egg to spark the hatchin'\nMake it happen, and take this captain to the gallows\nI keep steering us into an area that's shallow\nTalking to my shadow, he advised me not to worry\nSaid, I should plant my tree and let it rise out of the fury\nSo give me some light, a little love and some liquid\nI'ma creep through the night and put a plug in the spigot\nAnd when the water grows, and the dam starts to overflow\nI'll float atop the flood holdin' on to my ugly\n[Chorus]\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\n\n[Verse 3]\nWhy scream, when you can lose yourself inside the widescreen\nLet life be a bowl of melted ice cream\nOr be the deer that's caught in my high beams\nI'm rolling with the brights on\nScared stiff, reality is just too much to bear with\nParanoid, walking around, careless\nNo wonder you're in love with your therapist\nGo to sleep my little time bomb\n\n[Chorus]\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly\nGod loves ugly, God loves-God loves ugly33Embed"

I got stuck\nThey can peel pieces of me off the grill of her truck\nUsed to walk with luck, used to hold her hand\nFell behind and played the role of a slower man\nI want to stand on top of this mountain and yell\nI want to wake up and break up this lake of hell\nI feel like a bitch for letting the sheet twist me up\nThe last star-fighter was wounded, time to give it up\nOn a pick it up mission, kept it bitter\nGettin' in a million memories just to forget her\nThe difficulty in keepin' emotions controlled\nCookies for the road, took me by the soul\nHunger for the drama, hunger for the nurture\nGonna take it further, the hurt feels like murder\nInterpret the eyes, read the lines on her face\nThe sunshine is fake, how much time did I waste?\nFuck you, Lucy, for leaving me\nFuck you, Lucy, for not needing me\nI wanna say fuck you because I still love you\nNo, I'm not okay, and I don't know what to do\n[Hook]\n(Yes, yes it is)\nAnd everyone in his life would mistake it as love\nEveryone in his life would mistake it as love\nEveryone in his life would mistake it as love\n(Yes, yes it is)\nAnd everyone in his life would mistake it as love\nEveryone in his life would mistake it as love\nEveryone in his life would mistake it as love\n\n[Verse 3: Slug]\nDo I sound mad? Well I guess I'm a little pissed\nEvery action has a point, five points make a fist\nYou close em', you swing em', it's hurts when it hits\nAnd the truth can be a bitch, but if the boot fits\nI got an idea, you should get a tattoo that says warning\nThat's all, just a warning, so the potential victim can take a left\nAnd save breath, and avoid you, sober and upset in the morning\nI wanna scream, \"Fuck you, Lucy\"\nBut the problem is I love you, Lucy\nSo instead I'ma finish my drink and have another\nWhile you think about how you used to be my lover\n\n[Hook]\n(Yes, yes it is)\nAnd everyone in his life would mistake it as love\nEveryone in his life would mistake it as love\nEveryone in his life would mistake it as love\n(Yes, yes it is)\nAnd everyone in his life would mistake it as love\nEveryone in his life would mistake it as love\nEveryone in his life would mistake it as love\n[Outro: Women Singing]\nIt - leave - never - would - you - you - show - could - I - if18Embed"

   "lyrics": "Modern Man\u2019s Hustle Lyrics[Verse 1]\nThe first time I met the devil was at a Motel 6\nShe left hell to spend a weekend on Earth just for kicks\nSexy little bitch, shorter than expected\nAbout 5 foot 5, big and thick in the breast and thighs\nBeautiful, dark eyes, a strong stare\nLarge lips, soft hands, and long hair\nI said I'll make you smile for the simple fact I'm good at it\nI'll make you smile just so I can sit and look at it\n\n[Chorus]\nI will show you all you need to know\nYou must hold on to anyone that wants you\nAnd I will love you through simple and the struggle\nBut girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle\nI will show you all you need to know\nYou must hold on to anyone that wants you\nAnd I will love you through simple and the struggle\nBut girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle\n[Verse 2]\nWho cares what Jane says? She always spits the same spit\nI'd rather kill the radio and listen to the rain hit\nLittle sister needs seclusion, some how she'll discover it through the pop music\nGot used to the feeling of falling, but she'll never see her following\nBouncing back and forth between the healing and the hollering\nRiding the outer ring of your own private saturn\nThoughts scattered all across the grey matter\nLittle baby doll she doesn't know what to say to ya'll\nThe patience is short and of course the pride is way too tall\nBreak it all smash the past like it was made of glass\nAin't no other way to make it last\nIt hurts to watch Lucy lucid dream\nI've had the pleasure of seeing our hero kick and scream\nAnd when she calms down I'll turn the sound down\nAnd put my arms around the little lost and found and I'll tell her that\n\n[Chorus]\nI will show you all you need to know\nYou must hold on to anyone that wants you\nAnd I will love you through simple and the struggle\nBut girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle\nI will show you all you need to know\nYou must hold on to anyone that wants you\nAnd I will love you through simple and the struggle\nBut girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle\n[Verse 3]\nHush little lady don't say a word\nOr the rest of the village gonna know you're disturbed\nAnd if you let them know that you're vulnerable\nThen there ain't no stopping how far they open you slow (yo yo yo)\nI'm a chapter in your textbook read me like a checkbook\nMistook love at first sight for a sex look\nEnough of the blind man's bluff\nI want the good stuff\nTrying to hook up a full belly and a foot rub\nThe modern man's hustle I dig it, I shuffle\nFeed me your troubles and need me to cuddle (come on)\nBundle up in my mitten and coat\nAs cold as it gets I keep your winter afloat\nSo let the snow fall (it's coming down)\nShe doesn't want to understand why I still come around\nShe looks at the mirror, she don't see what I see\nShe holds no history of how precious she be\nLay your head on my chest, speak of the stress\nKick your feet up and rest, before we clean up the nest\nI hate to see you upset, it cramps the position\nAnd if you didn't know, you better listen (you better listen 'cause)\n\n[Chorus]\nI will show you all you need to know\nYou must hold on to anyone that wants you\nAnd I will love you through simple and the struggle\nBut girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle\nI will show you all you need to know\nYou must hold on to anyone that wants you\nAnd I will love you through simple and the struggle\nBut girl, you got to understand the modern man must hustle14Embed"

It's not mine, I promise\nI found it on my block in between a couple garages\nDidn't want to leave it for a child to stumble over\nI don't even know how to hold it\"\nIt was a thirty eight, the poor man's machete\nHeld it in my hand, thinking damn man it's heavier than expected\nWedged it behind my belt buckle\nKnowing that it's evil, even thought that I could smell trouble\nThe extra strength felt weak\nBut over there on the corner saw what I needed\nAnd proceeded to cross the street\nPut the heat in the mail box to lose it\nFigured that the post office knows what's best to do with it\n\nMosey down the road, thinking about the old\nI used to roam this zone through two feet of snow\nRight here, this used to be a record shop\nI've gotten love, I've gotten drunk, I've gotten beat up in that parking lot\nI've had my Lake Street pride for 3 decades\nThese alleyways, and these streetlights have seen my best days\nBefore I was a germ learning how to misbehave\nAll the way to the grave, south side is my resting place\n\nTook a right on Lyndale I'm getting near\nBut then the road became empty and the people disappeared\nThe clouds ran away, opened up the sky\nAnd one by one I watched every constellation die\nAnd there I was frozen, standing in my backyard\nFace to face, eye to eye, staring at the last star\nI should've known, walked all the way home\nTo find that she wasn't here, I was still all alone\nNo matter where I am, no matter what I do\nI'm always coming back home to you\nThey can leave me for dead they can take away my true\nI'm always coming back home to you\nThrough the lies and the sins that ride the wind that blew\nI'm always coming back home to you\nAs sure as the life in the garden that you grew\nI'm always coming back home to you\nNo matter where I am, no matter what I do\nI'm always coming back home to you\nIf only I had known what you already knew\nI'm always coming back home to you\nFrom the heaven I've had to the hell I been through\nI'm always coming back home to you\nI'm always coming back home to you15Embed"

    "plain": "The song addresses the failure of society, as a whole, both individuals and the masses (i.e. CNN, Fox, the news..) to accept blame for the pitfalls of our society. Instead of trying to identify and fix our issues, we instead try to blame everything under the sun for our shortcomings.\n\nThis song is from the debut album of Atmosphere named \u201cOvercast!\u201d\n\nWhile \u2018God\u2019s Bathroom Floor\u2019 was our local breakout song, this was the song that was our national breakout to the rap underground. While it did get us booked on mix shows across the country, I felt it was almost a 'cheating\u2019 style of writing. I use the word \u2018It\u2019s\u2019 over 50 times. That\u2019s the hook. It\u2019s cheating.

Instead of trying to identify and fix our issues, we instead try to blame everything under the sun for our shortcomings.\n\nThis song is from the debut album of Atmosphere named \u201cOvercast!\u201d\n\nWhile \u2018God\u2019s Bathroom Floor\u2019 was our local breakout song, this was the song that was our national breakout to the rap underground. While it did get us booked on mix shows across the country, I felt it was almost a 'cheating\u2019 style of writing. I use the word \u2018It\u2019s\u2019 over 50 times. That\u2019s the hook. It\u2019s cheating.

   "lyrics": "Sound Is Vibration Lyrics[Slug]\nI'm sparked, waiting for the dark to hit\nCause once the moon gets above my apartment\nI catch fits for starting shit\nI'm smart with it, I give it that special touch when I push it\nCause I'm also a label rep, and I can't allow no bullshit\nSo shush kid, shush baby! Shut your eyes\nLay your head back, shed the fear and let the tears crystallize\nI wish the flies to land upon your forehead\nWhen I extract the essence from your head\nAnd leave your body resting Moorhead\nI left more dead reputations than HIV can\nBut for every killing there's a reason and it's not just MC's, man!\nI'm watching C-SPAN, waiting for the first state rep\nTo take the first step, to have to kill off to make this world perfect\nWell lets get shit right, right here! Right now! Right away!\nAtmosphere motherfucker! If I need to I could fly away\nI'll grind you and your weak crew into beef stew\nServe you with seafood\nYou can't cloud my vision cuz you're see-through\n[Spawn]\nYou need to recognize the size of the Atmos\nYou ain't as tall as half this - Madness- past what you practice\nRSE you can't fuck with my tactics, you bastard\nThats why you breath fast bitch - no need to ask\n\n[Slug]\nWe dug the fingernails underneath the skin of your scalp, then peeled it\nSent your underdeveloped pre-school style on a field trip\nNow bite your tongue, this is how the mic gets stung\nA whole tree to pick some fruit from, man!\nYou had to choose the ripest one\n\n[Spawn]\nThat said it all, it comes from inside, and how you ride\nThe sound wire when it's live and the vibes feelin right\nCatchin' the motion given by rhythms when you hit 'em on time\nWith lines, makin' sure your rhyme soundin' tight\nYour voice should travel without the babble of the average emcee\nSo listen please use discretion when you breath\nSound is vibration, I choose to use it with a vision\nAnd then comes the style and precision...\n\n[Slug]\nNo more longer will we hold your hands\nWhy? Cause you're too damn old\nOh yea, the network called\nThey told me to tell ya you've been cancelled\nThey also said big up for all the support\nThanks to your devotion, they now control the world\nSo let your hair down and eat the poison with a tall glass of Tang\nI'm rising past the bank, with smile I'm flashin my fangs\nI tumble over some, cuz some I don't over stand\nI got the plot from Spawn, from now on, I know the plan\n[Spawn]\nIt's the noise it makes, that generates the passion I have\nIt's the void it breaks, that stimulates when mics get grabbed\nIt takes shape - escapes from these vocal chords I have\nAtmosphere: music makers from the Rhymesayers lab\n\n[Slug]\nCome now, who fi me gwan test the giants when we apply this\nVice grips to your eyelids to make you read the fine print\nThe tyrants that gave you crisis, left you silenced\nDon't breath a sigh of relief 'till you hear the rescue sirens\n\n[Spawn]\nSupreme, be this team, we got this shit on lock\nRSE we hid the key under an upscale rock\nSo you could knock all you want to but you ain't gettin' in\nYou could try to crash the door but you ain't gettin' in\nNigga, what! My definition is raw, I got you all\nWishin' I'd fall, so things could get better for y'all\nBut I'm tall, and got game, remain the same for the duration\n\nArea code 6-1-2, my present location...\n\n[Slug]\nAtmosphere...embellished with talent and the wisdom not abuse it\nBlessed with insight, friends and influences\nThats what keeps us dope, what makes us dope is the surroundings\nInspiration stems from love and stress compounding\nStamina: that is achieved over the course of time\nIn fact, time taught me how to breath, battle, not to court my mind\nDefined as lyricist - the Atmosphericist\nMakin sure you fear this hit every time you hear this shit\n[Spawn] Sound is vibration\n[Slug] This sound is taken\n[Spawn] Sound is vibration\n[Slug] And the ground is shaken\n[Spawn] Vibration is sound\n[Slug] Yo, we found your replacement\n[Spawn] Vibration is sound\n[Slug] Now who makes the sound?\n\n[Slug & Spawn] : Now who makes the music/sound?

Probably so\nI found your tape in my old collection\nPut it in pushed play then I poured a fresh one\nI look back with a hesitant laugh\nBut in reality it\u2019s dark down memory ave\nAll the trials and suffering we shared with each other\nA lot of people thought that we were actually brothers\nYou know me, you know I\u2019m a control freak\nWho told you, you could die before me?\nGone, another dog lost to the wild\nI feel like a snot-nosed child\nAnd when I hear your Smile\nIts outlined in sadness\nYou poked holes in the magic\nYou taught jokes to the clowns\nThat never learned how\nTo appreciate the lights\nBefore the bulbs burned out\nFlicker\n[Hook]\nOne little flicker of light\nCan erase the dark\nOne little flicker of light\nCan erase the dark\n\n[Verse 2]\nYeah, I been thinking, You already know\nDo I sound frustrated? Probably so\nSometimes I feel guilty, I was out on the road\nIf I\u2019da seen where it was going I\u2019da stopped the whole show\nI realize it ain\u2019t realistic\nI keep tryna make the pieces fit with\nThe info presented\nI felt resentment\nI held this against myself\nI wanna help my friend\nIt stays in my head\nThat I was on a stage when you were laying in bed\nBody was discovered by your own mother\nIt penetrates my chest, I still taste the regret\nThat I slept through a late night call from your homie\nBut then I spoke with Siddiq the next morning\nAnd then I smoked one million cigarettes\nGo figure, maybe I was tryna catch up with ya\nFlicker\n[Hook]\nOne little flicker of light\nCan erase the dark\nOne little flicker of light\nCan erase the dark\n\n[Verse 3]\nYeah I been sinkin\u2019, you already know\nDo I look exhausted? Probably so\nI don\u2019t get much sleep\nI\u2019m not sick, I\u2019m fine\nI\u2019m just tryna make the most of this limited time\nAnd I\u2019m missing you but I ain\u2019t gonna lie\nThe distance grew between Eye and I\nAnd at the end, even though we didn\u2019t speak enough\nYou were easily one of the best people I\u2019ve loved\nNow I\u2019m tryna write a song for a dead songwriter\nThat wrote they own songs about life and death\nAnd every breath is full of self-awareness\nDon\u2019t ever be afraid to be embarrassed\nSo I wrote these words to describe what I cry about\nBut I\u2019m certain if you were here right now\nYou\u2019d ridicule these lyrics, you\u2019d hate this chorus\nYou\u2019d probably tell me that the concept is too straight forward\nFlicker\n[Hook]\nOne little flicker of light\nCan erase the dark\nOne little flicker of light\nCan erase the dark22Embed"

How it goes?\nYeah, me? Well, you know, you know, same old, same old\nSorry that the phone calls ain't too routine\nJust been runnin' around the globe tryin' to do my thing\nSometimes the weeks fly a little too fast\nAnd sometimes I go to sleep a little too trashed\nOther times I'm not sittin' on enough cash\nAnd other times today feels too much like the past\nSometimes at night I would watch y'all fight\nA child wonderin'\nWhy your life just ain't alright?\nWhat's the violence about? Why's it in my house?\nAnd even the memories are turned up too loud\nYeah, I got some issues in my head\nKnew we should've started fixing 'em back when she left you\nI'm not trying to get you down, I know you're different now\nBut your little man just wants you to listen now\nI'm over 30, can't maintain relations\nAll these women want to hurt me and I just don't have the patience\nI can't trust them, and they're not much help\nWhen they start to push and pull the buttons I don't trust myself\nWhat pride, fists, and words just might do?\nI'm afraid of my fate, don't wanna turn out like you\nI've never hit a woman\nI won't do coke\nAnd for that alone I love you and I want to thank you, old man\n[Verse 3: Slug]\nDear Sean, what's going on? Not much to say\nJust checkin' in with you, trying to see what's wrong today\nI know there's gotta be something kicking your bruises\nHow's the love? How's the music? How's the self-abusiveness?\nGot a lot to lose, it's breaking your shoulders\nSo you let your paranoia place your bets for you\nToo many cigarettes, messing up your voice\nToo many arguments, trying to test your poise\nThe only women that love you are fans and family\nMom has no choice, but fans leave you randomly\nNo heavy rotation in any location\nYou're not ready to face that you have no steady vocation\nPlus you're getting old, your raps are exhausted\nStop it, everybody knows that you've lost it\nSinging for these kids you don't know\nWhen you should be at home with your own instead you're on the telephone\nFighting with your girl like it's you against the world\nAnother drunk hotel bedroom corner, curled up like a naked fetus\nCome and save him Jesus\nPlace him back in time before the Reaganomics and Adidas\nSometimes you're not impressed with the work you've done\nAnd love isn't love if you didn't hurt someone\nYour son says, \"Hi dad\", your dad says, \"What's up?\"\nAnd me, I wanna thank you, but I won't, I'll just say, \"Good luck.\"15Embed"

He is homeless, so it is a place for him to stay, but he actually wants to see a woman that works there. She constantly tells him to leave, he still goes back because he loves her.\nThe song initially makes it sound as if the man is in love with the woman he doesn\u2019t really know, but the last line reveals a possibilty she\u2019s his own daughter.\n\nTom Waits provides the beat box effect for this song."

Right Now!... Let's go!\n\n[Hook]x23Embed"
