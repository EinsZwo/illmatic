   "lyrics": "Doug Stamper (Advice Raps) Lyrics[Intro]\nRappers belong to things\nThey got affiliations and shit and I do too\nBut fuck gangbanging, yeah\n\n[Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]\nLife's kind of sucky bro\nIf you hearing this consider yourself lucky though\nSharks in the boardroom program for guppies\nBaby cuddle bunny in the box full of puppies, sho\nNo perm, grow a 'fro like Pam Grier\nDon't say 'bro' bruh say manssiere, yeah\nAny karaoke fans here?\nIf so, never get drunk and do Kashmir\nIt's not a good choice\nAnd white rappers quit rapping in your hood voice\nSound like a clown hundred pounder that took 'roids\nRrra-rrra-rrra-rrra-rrra, rrra-rrra-rrra...\nDon't do videos for tracks with your back to the cameraman\nPhones, get the family packing big data plan\n'99 Problems' was a damn good summer song\nIf you got more than like three then something's wrong\n[Chorus: Open Mike Eagle]\nYou're drowning in quicksand\nYou're flailing in the water\nYour hands are waving all frantic\nYou'll die within the hour\nUnless you do what we tell you to do\nMe and my whole fam we Doug Stamper\n(Yeah, yeah, and here's the...)\nSo you should do what we tell you to do\n(Mmmhhh-ahhh, timing, shit!)\nI say, good God damn we Doug Stamper\n\n[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]\nYeah, and here's the bush I would never beat around\nNever march through Korea Town in a Madea gown\nYeah, you know, like a muumuu\nAnd never buy used from that dude Joe Isuzu\nIf you find yourself down in Southern Illinois\nCop a mixtape from DJ Snowy Boo-boo, (that's a real dude?) yeah\nAnd don't start dumb arguments\nOr show flowcharts to an art-numb Parliament\nAnd stand guard by your dart gun armament\nAnd memorize your parts like a sharp-tongued artisan\nAlways tell a lie to C.I.A. torturers\nNever buy weed from a guy named Mortimer\nBuy bank forfeitures and foreclosures\nIf you start to lose your hair skip the comb-over\nWhen you home open a game with the Orioles\nA journalist should never write a slang editorial\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nYou're drowning in quicksand\nYou're flailing in the water\nYour hands are waving all frantic\nYou'll die within the hour\nUnless you do what we tell you to do\nMe and my whole fam we Doug Stamper\nSo you should do what we tell you to do\nI say, good God damn we Doug Stamper\n\n[Verse 3: Hannibal Buress]\nYou a grown man, do what I told you to\nStop pissing on the motherfucking toilet stool (disgusting)\nWash your hands when you touch your lil dirty dick\nAnd dry 'em off before you come trying to shake my shit (get outta here)\nYou a ho if your Facebook is complicated\nEat your fruit fiber, bitch, or get constipated (grrr)\nNo finger waves, except Babyface\nLeBron James needs to stop taking HGH\nHis hairline fucked up from the HGH\nWent from one headband to like, eighty-eight\nYou ain't a thug, stop acting like you've been through shit\nStop paying for them porn site memberships (that shit's a waste)\nGo to YouPorn nigga, that shit is free\nBut don't bootleg my comedy, pay the fee (buy it)\nTell your cousin, stay the fuck from off of Worldstar\nAnd don't buy a Honda Civic, that's a girl's car\n[Outro: Hannibal Buress]\nAnd don't buy a Chevy Aveo, or a Mini Cooper\nOr... Yaris\nAnd don't, don't set stuff on fire either\nActually, if... If you can only afford one of those cars\nCause those are compact cars and are very affordable\nThen get that, don't let me judge your life\nBut that other stuff, I mean that other stuff\nYeah8Embed"

If I'm in this\nOld school letterman, never been\nI'd like to ask if you know the code, guess again\nIs a game barely controlled that they don't give\nLike they gon' live forever\nPoliticians on straw-man missions\nStumble into town looking all ambitious\nIt's the ballad of Peter Pumpkinhead\nHe won't eat the Wonder Bread\nHe won't pledge allegiances\nMy saints is dead comedians\nTrying to taste this cred is meaningless\nThat shit is warping my soul\n[Pre-Chorus]\nKnee-deep in the same dirt\nOnly water divides us\nSame places, different continents\nAnd my head-space is an island\nI swim freely through my phylum\nI'm tuned to radio silence\nCame to me while I was driving\nRight then, it was decided\n\n[Chorus]\nI ain't never been to this planet\nMake eye contact and I'm smiling\n[x4]\nEye to eye...\n\n[Verse 2]\nWoke up thinking I'm Batman\nEvery town is like Gotham\nI log into my twitter page\nAnd start bending over like Gollum\nThis dumb cred is like crack rock\nAnd I never seem to hit bottom\nMy representative smiling at you like\n\"What the fuck is the problem?\"\nWalk uncharted lands with no squad\nSpots my ancestors picked cotton\nThey want me to carry their customs\nWhen I know the truth is postmodern\nI won't walk like an Egyptian\nDon't talk like I be pimpin'\nThere's in-groups and there's out-groups\nAnd I believe in making distinctions\nI just smile and offer you greetings\nHopefully with no pretense\nMy aim's to honor your physical\nAnd leave room for all of your secrets\nWe should all play a big Scrabble game\nAnd make every word a confession:\n\"A-N-X-I-O-U-S.\"\nYou might also like[Pre-Chorus + Chorus]5Embed"

   "lyrics": "Dark Comedy Late Show Lyrics[Intro: Open Mike Eagle]\nWe have a fuckin', uh, incredible show for you tonight\nPardon me for saying \"Fuckin'\" on network television\u2014\nI'm not gonna have this job for long\u2014It's Exile!\nIt's me, it's you. These are our guests\nLet's go. Yeah\n\n[Open Mike Eagle]\nI gave up and became a Spotify-er\nPaying myself a fraction of a penny playing \"Qualifiers\"\nI'm looking up and I'm stuck in a Chucky movie\nSaying yucky shit for chuckles like it's Lucky Louie\nSo somebody better cancel me\nBefore I get a chance to screen this ass-naked dance routine\nIt's dark comedy, cold as a soldier's stare\nI've been exposed, so now the LOLs is my over-wear\nAnd I'm a polar bear with words for a fancy song\nI think it's the first verse from Little Miss Can't Be Wrong\nFuck you, I like the Spin Doctors\nIs that dude Finn's father or just an impostor?\nThe new internet thing's to be pretend awkward\nNon-prescription, thick-rimmed frames and rented gym lockers\nI'm a rapper, we lament being broke\nAll the comics get money, but they spend it on coke\nYou can watch us on the newsfeeds\nFucking y'all's mornings up\nUntil America admits that it likes dogs more than us\nAnd I can see the Super Bowls of the future:\nThe Ferguson blacks vs. Missouri State Troopers\nThe privacy rights vs. the personal computers\nConcussion researchers vs. university boosters\nI graduated college, I purchased all the extra books\nI'm supposed to be living in a house with a breakfast nook\nJoke's on me, though\nAll this cheap alcohol and no Coke Zero\nAshamed how proximity kills yo heroes\nHey, yo, no poking, I'm still woke, Cee-Lo\nYeah, It's all ripped from the headlines\nI'm all outta options like a Crip on the red line\nI got a deadline, before I never had a deal\nStormed out of business meetings, slipped on mass banana peels\nI should probably shut my stupid mouth\nShirtless in a fur hat and Vladimir Putin pout\nAnd North Korea's got practice missiles\nAnd I still check Yahoo cause we both got attachment issues\nOur Congress moves just like a cult could\nInvade Iraq 15 times in my adulthood\nAnd we quit asking for the reasons\nAnd clicked the Constitution's terms of service agreements\nWe're dreaming from sundown to high noon\nAnd woke up by U2 albums all in your iTunes\nAnd it's close to a all out war\nWith kids being murdered just for being black and tall outdoors\nThey respond to demonstrations wearing kevlar briefs\nWhen the main problem is nobody respects our grief\nThey say if it bends it's funny, if it breaks it ain't though\nI still got broke pockets and trying to host the Late Show\nRecording it every night, but I don't know where the tape go\nHomeless fashionistas tell me everything that they know\nYeah, you got a style\nTie them fancy sandals up, smile\nYou on the NSA's candid cameras, now\nI'm in a church basement learning Shotokan\nI saw Jesus taking a selfie and I photobombed\nAnd dude better tag me\nA little recognition makes me do better gladly\nLike this one time when I got booed at a track meet\nIn a Hellfyre Club sweater for two letter athletes\nOne for regret dreams, one for most suppressed team\nPressure valve gets released and sprays like a jet stream\nKarl Kani\u2019s and Z Cavaricci\u2019s from Chess King\nK-Mart name brands were the least interesting\nI appreciated presidential speeches on the West Wing\nI never had wet dreams or piloted an X-Wing\nI'm still terrible at being sarcastic black\nMy man Exile, he knows what I'm laughing at\nMy man Toy-Light, he knows what I'm laughing at\nThe studio audience knows what I'm laughing at\n[Outro: Open Mike Eagle]\nLaughing at all types of shit\nI laugh at, um, CNN. I don't know why\nThat might be an issue; that might be a problem actually\nIt's not, it's not a humorous channel, you know what I mean?\nIt's not trying to compete with Comedy Central\nIf anything, it's trying to compete with Headline News\nWhich I'm pretty sure is like the same company\nOr it's trying to compete with, uh, MSNBC kinda\nMSNBC is blue and to the left\nCNN is red, white, and black, and in the middle\nAnd Fox News is bright red and hollerin', and on the right\nAnd there's an elephant and a donkey\nAnd then an eledonkeyphant. A donkaphant\nUh, a helladonkaphant. ShitYou might also like7Embed"

Ain't no bitches, hoes\"\nAnd I ain't even being funny, homie didn't know\nShoulda said it's whimsical\nLike Serengeti taught me\nMy thoughts are very lofty\nResponse time is very faulty\nI'm far too young to lead\nAnd way too old to die\nI ain't played Call of Dookie, smoke you in GoldenEye\nRPG, roll the die\nJPG Kobe Tai\nPG 13 Cobra Kai\nPPG Luc Robitaille\nYou might also like[Hook]\nWe're the best, mostly\nSometimes the freshest rhymers\nWe the tightest kinda\nRespect my qualifiers\nRespect my qualifiers\nRespect my qualifiers\nRespect my qualifiers\nWe're the best, mostly\nSometimes the freshest rhymers\nWe the tightest kinda\nRespect my qualifiers\nRespect my qualifiers\nRespect my qualifiers\nRespect my qualifiers\n\n[Outro]\nI didn't write the words you hear me singing\nI didn't sing a line before this one\nAnd you are not the one I was addressing\nThat person took a train to Africa\nAnd simultaneous events don't happen\nWe are isolated temporally\nAnd the part is never called the whole thing\nThough it bothers us to know it so8Embed"

    "plain": "This song introduces Iron Hood, the superhero/alter ego played by Open Mike Eagle, based in part on Juggernaut from the X-Men.\n\nThe Juggernaut alludes to the attitude of being a \u201ctough guy\u201d.  However, while the Juggernaut is tough he is still prone to mental weakness.  This mental weakness is embodied by the Juggernaut\u2019s step brother, Charles Xavier, who is repeatedly brought up throughout the song.  While the Juggernaut may be physically strong he is still subject to telepathic attack from his step brother.  To compensate for his mental weakness the Juggernaut wears a helmet to protect him from Xavier.\n\nThis whole song can be thought of as an allegory for the mentality people are forced to have when growing up or living in tough communities.  To protect themselves people often don a \u201ctough guy\u201d persona when in reality they are still vulnerable to emotional pain.\n\nFrom Open Mike Eagle\u2019s Twitter:\n\n\nthis song is about a traumatized super hero that has a helmet made out of a radiator and the power to walk through gunfire.\n\nthe guitar on this song is by dan miller from they might be f'n giants"

    "plain": "\u201cBrick Body Complex,\u201d is a powerful and political proclamation of identity and strength told from the perspective of a project building and the individuals residing within it. Open Mike Eagle throughout the song construes the idea that he is as giant and as immovable as the old brick buildings, his lyrics standing together in uniformity like the wall of protesters seen within the music video.\n\nThe buildings Michael is referring to in this song are the public housing complex named Robert Taylor Homes \u2014 28 high-rise buildings, 16 stories each that resided in South Side Chicago. Eagle spent a chunk of his childhood living in these projects alongside his aunt and cousins. In 2007, all of the buildings were torn down, displacing thousands of families from their homes, one third of which are still unaccounted for.\n\nIn the music video, Mike portrays a superhero character named \u201cIron Hood\u201d who attempts to save the public housing project from being destroyed and replaced by commercial properties. He fights a masked man who seems to personify all of the people who had a hand in the buildings' destruction. In the end he loses, and is seemingly arrested by the police.\n\nThroughout the song, Mike paints this picture of himself as a humongous 16-story building that is strong, sturdy, and indestructible. Seeing himself as a grandeur masterpiece that will live on forever, but sadly this is not the truth of the situation. In reality,  nothing is fair and everything eventually comes to an end\u2026 even the project buildings that he once resided in.\n\nThe \u201cBrick Body Complex\u201d seems to be the belief that you or the things that you hold dear are immortal when in reality things can be taken from you in the blink of an eye, fairly or otherwise."

    "plain": "As the chorus suggests, the song is about how a \u201cBlack Mirror episode ruined [Open Mike Eagle\u2019s] marriage.\u201d In a New York Times interview, Mike said:\n\nIt wasn\u2019t like we called it quits that night, but we were watching an episode with this couple in it, and I don\u2019t think we were able to come back from that.\n\nBlack Mirror is a science fiction anthology series streaming on Netflix since 2011. It\u2019s about the positive and negative consequences of technology. The show is famous for exploring the various ways our own technological inventions could cause our downfall.\n\n\n\nAfter repeatedly being asked about which episode he was talking about, Mike responded on Twitter:\n\nI will never say what the black mirror episode is. tho quite a few people have guessed correctly.\n\nWhile the show includes several episodes about relationships and people\u2019s emotional issues, most fans speculate he\u2019s talking about the season-one-finale, \u201cThe Entire History of You.\u201d The episode takes place in a future where humans can get a memory implant that records everything they do, see, and hear."

       "plain": "As the chorus suggests, the song is about how a \u201cBlack Mirror episode ruined [Open Mike Eagle\u2019s] marriage.\u201d In a New York Times interview, Mike said:\n\nIt wasn\u2019t like we called it quits that night, but we were watching an episode with this couple in it, and I don\u2019t think we were able to come back from that.\n\nBlack Mirror is a science fiction anthology series streaming on Netflix since 2011. It\u2019s about the positive and negative consequences of technology. The show is famous for exploring the various ways our own technological inventions could cause our downfall.\n\n\n\nAfter repeatedly being asked about which episode he was talking about, Mike responded on Twitter:\n\nI will never say what the black mirror episode is. tho quite a few people have guessed correctly.\n\nWhile the show includes several episodes about relationships and people\u2019s emotional issues, most fans speculate he\u2019s talking about the season-one-finale, \u201cThe Entire History of You.\u201d The episode takes place in a future where humans can get a memory implant that records everything they do, see, and hear."

This is part of an ongoing theme in Open Mike\u2019s music to support and make changes to neighborhoods in Chicago, specifically the one he grew up in."

On the track, Mike describes the issues he has with the hood, which has been known for being very crime ridden.\n\n\n\nHe proposes a \u201cHappy Wasteland Day\u201d, a holiday that prevents all violence. This is part of an ongoing theme in Open Mike\u2019s music to support and make changes to neighborhoods in Chicago, specifically the one he grew up in."

Dawn, and Sun Ra\nWearing a suit like my school mascot\nThe Edison owl not a head in the crowd\nCould match my technique and impeccable style (style)\nSays the young Hassan\nIn the mirror while Tip's saying \"rock-rock-on\"\nWith my guy Stefan who despite the specs\nSaw himself doing things he would live to regret\nAnyway, reciting off top the memory\nBurnt a little chia my laugh was Gimli (heh)\nRegarding the guns I coulda shot\nI'm more Dove might blow up but won't pop\nJigsaw blocks and hop the road home\nSteps on the Ave where I played and roamed\n\n[Chorus: Open Mike Eagle]\nAnd we drove all through the neighborhood\nJust sittin' in a car all day\nTryna find a radio\nAnd we wrapped both hands in tinfoil\nPointed at the window frame\nTryna find a radio\nAll up in my grandma's basement\nSlidin' all the closet doors\nTryna find a radio\nAnd the homies say they heard a rap song\nSounded like some folks they know\nBut we couldn't find a radio\nYou might also like[Verse 2: Open Mike Eagle]\nThe old me would drink a 40\nAnd eat bologna, shinobi\nOn NBA Live, I play with Kobe\nThe OGs, I miss my old hood\nMiss my homies, is lonely\nThe radio host is like they know me\nThe ocean with the seashell is how we floatin'\nWas hopin' to hear the airwaves, I think it's broken\nI can still play it if the tape resurfaces\nKept the old Boombox for just these purposes\nHeard a day show had mine on there recently\nPeople had a hard time finding the frequency\nPiece of me show feels personal\nCircled on all sides by used car commercials\nIt's worth it though, whole block listenin'\n'cept the kids, they so not interested\nImplement new COINTELPRO's\nHooks, fit loops, copyrighted by Velcro\nWhole sound changed, don't nobody want to sell those\nCall the intercom yab this is my bellcote\n\n[Chorus: Open Mike Eagle]\nAnd we drove all through the neighborhood\nJust sittin' in a car all day\nTryna find a radio\nAnd we wrapped both hands in tinfoil\nPointed at the window frame\nTryna find a radio\nAll up in my grandma's basement\nSlidin' all the closet doors\nTryna find a radio\nAnd the homies say they heard a rap song\nSounded like some folks they know\nBut we couldn't find a radio3Embed"

    "plain": "In professional wrestling, selling your opponent\u2019s moves is an important part of drawing the crowd into the match. Selling involves exaggerating the impact and pain inflicted by maneuvers to make the match believable and exciting. In this song, Mike references the act of \u201cno selling\u201d which is, as it sounds, not reacting to your opponent\u2019s moves in a way that shows pain or weakness. In wrestling, this can show toughness in a particular character while being generally disrespectful to the other wrestler.\n\nMike uses this metaphor to play on the expectations of men to not show emotional vulnerability even when they are clearly in physical or psychological pain (eg. misspelling his name). Many cultures idealize the overly masculine man who maintains his composure through trauma. It\u2019s likely that Mike wishes he could show more genuine emotion without fearing that it would come across as weakness.\n\nAccording to Open Mike Eagle\u2019s Twitter, \u201cUncle Butch\u201d refers to his uncle that fought in Vietnam."

   "lyrics": "American Religion (Celebrity Reduction Prayer) Lyrics[Produced by: Oddisee]\n\n[Intro]\nLa-la-la-la-la\nI know I invited you, I still want you to leave now\nThis is a whole long thing just telling you to leave my mind, leave\n\n[Verse 1: Open Mike Eagle]\nI woke up down in this dungeon\nI've made mistakes in my judgments\nI've built you up in my head this is my prayer for your reduction\nYou're not my aunt, uncle or cousin\nNot your nephew or your husband\nYou think just 'cause you buzzin' you got licence but you doesn't\nI hugged you like a glo-worm, come down now cause it's your turn\nI ain't got nothing but time I like that long haul to that slow burn\nI did too much of my homework\nKilled my confidence with this research\nI've put people on pedestals ego's reaction is knee-jerk\nI'm trying to work on my weakness\nIt's not all roses and peaches, it's no secret\nI've found myself in a funk for a whole weekend\nOver email failures and DMs\n\"Did they get that shit? Should I re-send?\"\nWhat should I do when I see them?\nTalk all soft and passive like Cleveland\nEven wise men can go mindless\nVoluntarily rocking them blinders\nIt generates all this shyness calling some other human your highness\nThey forgot about when they punched clocks\nWith Capri Suns in their lunchbox\nBad haircut with them sunspots\nDrank fruit punch and wore dumb socks, yeah!\n[Hook]\nYou're not my moms, you're not my father\nNot my food, you're not my water\nNot your earth, get out my lava\nWhat the fuck is my problem?\nIt's a prayer for the American religion\nGet out my food, you're not my java\nNot my nurse, you're not my doctor\nNot my priest, you're not my lama\nWhat the fuck is my problem?\nIt's a prayer for the American religion\n\n[Verse 2]\nIt's not worth my attention\nLet alone all of these mentions\nThis first time is a warning, the next move is suspension\nGot my own lapses in thinking, my processes were stinking\nYou're not Gandhi, you're not Yoda, you're not President Linking\nGive a fuck if you was Oprah, Wolf Blitzer, or Al Roker\nIf you try to put yourself over I'll laugh at you like The Joker\nThis Hellfyre's my culture, put magic all in these cold words\nI'm you as the slogan putting up mirrors instead of these posters\nWatch me smash all of these idols got my own heavyweight title\nThere's no upper tier, we're all peers unless y'all want to be rivals\nTalent's just a foundation rapped in festivals and in basements\nIf I ever lost my head I got good friends to replace it\nGives a fuck if you're on TV, you still poop and you still pee-pee\nYou sat down and got started not knowing there wasn't no TP\nYou got up then and you waddled\nThat shit might happen tomorrow\nWhether you're a ball player, a stage actor, or international model\nI don't care, neither should no one, I'll say that shit to Hulk Hogan\nObama down to Joe Rogan\nHead of the studio that made Frozen\nMy brain's variable tape speed, SubGenius or hayseed\nTry waving your resume, all the sudden I can't read, yeah!\nYou might also like[Bridge]\nGet your name, fame can make you evil\nAnd that's the shame cause we done lost so many people\nIt gets ingrained we start behaving like a sheep do\nThis song is a prayer when you should aim it where you need to\nWhen you say it they believe you\nThis is a prayer and you should aim it where you need to\n\n[Hook]8Embed"

    "plain": "On this track, Open Mike Eagle provides an anthem for the headasses. \u201cHeadass\u201d can be used as a generic insult but generally means someone who\u2019s stupid, especially someone who is socially inept.\n\nShinji Ikari is the protagonist of Neon Genesis Evangelion, a cult classic manga and anime franchise. Shinji is a mech-pilot and a real headass. He is painfully introverted, nervous, and emotional. He even refused to pilot his mech, the Evangelion Unit-01, which became a meme.\n\n\n\nFellow mechi-pilot Asuka frequently insults Shinji with \u201canta baka!\u201d roughly \u201cyou idiot!\u201d or \u201cidiot Shinji!\u201d in English."

       "plain": "On this track, Open Mike Eagle provides an anthem for the headasses. \u201cHeadass\u201d can be used as a generic insult but generally means someone who\u2019s stupid, especially someone who is socially inept.\n\nShinji Ikari is the protagonist of Neon Genesis Evangelion, a cult classic manga and anime franchise. Shinji is a mech-pilot and a real headass. He is painfully introverted, nervous, and emotional. He even refused to pilot his mech, the Evangelion Unit-01, which became a meme.\n\n\n\nFellow mechi-pilot Asuka frequently insults Shinji with \u201canta baka!\u201d roughly \u201cyou idiot!\u201d or \u201cidiot Shinji!\u201d in English."

He must have never smoked herb\nBeen beaten by his dad or heard bad spoken word\nI got a pretty mean overbite\nI'm still trying to navigate the settings on my Focusrite preamp\nCondenser mic attached with a c-clamp\nWeed on the patio, chiefing under the heat lamp\nYeah, or sneak in with a G Pen\nAnd take that shit to church and stay high all weekend\nYeah, I'll fucking interrupt your telecast hella fast\nFrom blonde wig and blue eyed Ellen mask\n[Break]\nWatch me dance. Are you watching?\nI'm cold\n\n[Verse 2]\nWe should invest in inner-ear monitors\nAnd start our own niche and gain little weird followers\nYeah, that make the flyest orthotics\nAnd make decent movies out of Alan Moore comics\nYou can use Facebook to learn gang signs\nAnd creepers can stalk all their exes at the same time\nAnd if your rap career ain't hitting\nYou can rap over videos of kittens, it's the golden age!\nTell the internet how you got fucked over\nAnd buy a minivan with seventeen cupholders\nLegal opiates, having yourself a fever dream\nAnd you can watch a video of the bible's deleted scenes\nAnd nobody ever has to pay for anything\nWhich is pretty cool cause everybody's unemployed!\nI changed my rap name to Lil' Wonder Boy\nChange your rap name to Lil' Lord Fauntleroy\nAnd we can rap about all the different candy bars\nTry to get sponsors from Mounds and Almond Joy\nAnd Whatchamacallit, and Nestle Crunch, and Kit Kat\nAnd shit, Toblerone\nAnd watch Twin Peaks on your mobile phone\nAnd take a shot so you don't feel your broken bones\nAnd move close to home\nOr don't move out to begin with\nSmoke herb for your gout and your shin splints\nThis new colorful weed is pretty intense\nThere's thin mints that you can get after you finish wind sprints\nYou might also like[Outro]\nAnd I think that's it\nBut all that shit is great right?\nThat shit is cool!\n\n[Interview Excerpt Outro]\nAlso the hip-hop guys always have a giant posse also\nYeah I don't have them in the \u2014 [indistinguishable mumbling and laughing]\nWhy would I?\nYou don't have anything to ask?\nSo why don't you play guitar? You got samples\nNow are you rhyming instead of singing?\nWell, let me break hereEmbed"

Newly divorced, he\u2019s now trying to work out, dress fashionable, find a new place to live on an indie rapper\u2019s budget, all while dealing with the emotional fallout of the divorce and his fortieth birthday fast approaching.\n\nOn the ATD release show livestream from Dynasty Typewriter, Mike referenced the 2018 film Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse. One of the many spidermen we meet in that movie is Peter B. Parker, who is a depressed middle-aged man, separated from his wife. When we meet him, he\u2019s looking kinda schlubby with his depression sweats over his spidersuit."

Newly divorced, he\u2019s now trying to work out, dress fashionable, find a new place to live on an indie rapper\u2019s budget, all while dealing with the emotional fallout of the divorce and his fortieth birthday fast approaching.\n\nOn the ATD release show livestream from Dynasty Typewriter, Mike referenced the 2018 film Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse. One of the many spidermen we meet in that movie is Peter B. Parker, who is a depressed middle-aged man, separated from his wife. When we meet him, he\u2019s looking kinda schlubby with his depression sweats over his spidersuit."
