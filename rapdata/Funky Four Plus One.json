   "lyrics": "Rappin And Rocking The House Lyrics[Intro]\nThis is the way we rock the house\nShowin' up, everybody gonna turn it out\n\n[Verse 1:  KK + (Lil Rodney C) + Sha Rock + [Keith Keith] + Jazzy Jeff]\nWell I'm K.K. Rockwell 'cause it rock so swell\nEvery time ya' hear my name it rings a bell\n(Well I'm Lil Rodney C making history\nWith all the fly girls yellin' \"take me\")\nWell I'm Sha Rock and I can't be stopped\nFor all the fly guys, gonna hit the top\n[Well I'm Keith Keith but you can call me Keith Caesar\nThe reason why 'cause I'm the women pleaser]\nWell I'm Jazzy Jeff with the most finesse\nSay I do it to the rhythm 'til I do it the best\nNow we're the funky four and I'm the plus one more\nAnd this is the way we go back and forth\nWe're the five MC's y'all all too much\nWhen we rock the mic's, ah, with the magical touch\n(We're on time, we're masterminds\nWe hittin' the top and we run down the rhymes)\nThey're four fly guys, I'm the best female\nI'm tellin' the truth, not a fairytale\n[Now listen to the story that the five put down\nAnd it's guaranteed so let them travel around]\nNow we said it once and we said it twice\nNow we'll prove it to you that we're better than nice\n[Verse 2: Lil Rodney C + Jazzy Jeff]\nWell... let's go to work, let's go to work\nLet's go to go to go to go to go to go to work\nNow when I say your name and I talk about your game\nAnd I tell everybody how you got your fame\nAnd when it's time to say oh yeah\nBoogie to the rhythm like you just don't care\nIf you come to a party four boys turn out\nYou be prepared for DJ Breakout\nWhen you come on back you wanna do it again\nYou be prepared for DJ Baron\nIf you come to our party to hear quality\nYou be prepared for the five MC's\nIf you come to our party to hear clientele\nYou be prepared for K and Rockwell\nIf you come to our party to hear history\nYou be prepared 'cause I'm Lil Rodney C\nIf you come to our party 'cause you wanna be shocked\nYou be prepared for the girl Sha Rock\nIf you come to our party to feel relief\nYou be prepared for my mellow Keith Keith\nIf you come to our party to hear the best\nYou be prepared 'cause he's Jazzy Jeff\nIf you come to our party to move your feet\nYou be prepared for my mellow Jazzy D\nNow when come to our party and you don't wanna go\nYou blame it all, you just blame it all\nI said you blame it all on the Brothers Disco\nSee we got a little story we want you to know\nCheck it out, everybody this is how we go\nSay tic-tac-toe, we're all the go\nWe're a four sure shot of a disco show\nWe're the sure shot hit, of a four sure shot\nSo come on young ladies, use what you got\n'Cause we're five MC's that rock jazzy\nAnd there is the no one else who can't compete\n'Cause when we rap on the mic we take control\nWe can turn out any party with the voices of gold\n'Cause we're to hot to handle, to cold to hold\nBecause MC stands for mic control\nAnd when it comes to that we are the best\nWe can rock the north, south, the east, and west\nWith the tower of the power can you understand\nAnd we can turn out any party with the mic in our hand\nBecause we got it like that, can you do it like this\nOur names are on top of the MC list\nI say we advertise to mesmerize\nAnd we specialize to antagonize\nI say we qualify to neutralize\nWe'll make other MC's apologize\nWe got the personality to rock the young ladies\nThe authority to rock you to your knees\nThe convince-a-ty for all the youth to see\nWe want you to know the identities\nOf the five MC's with the capabilities\nI mean the rock and the mic cause anxiety\nWe want our name to be preached to every nationality\nWe got styles and finesse we be the almighty\nMC's with ability\nTo rock on and on and on\nAnd on and on and on\nYou just dip, dive, and socialize\nParty to the rhymes of the four fly guys\nYou might also like[Verse 3: Keith Keith]\nOne-two, one-two, one-two, two\nA-two, a-two, a-two, two\nJust rockin', just rockin', just rockin'\nRockin', rock, rock a rockin'\nRockin' for the women\nSo we make a little cut that'll make you move your butt\nAnd our bass'll blow you away\nAnd have the Funky 4 MC for the young ladies\nAnd we're sure enough here to stay\nAnd now you look us in the eyes then you get hypnotized\nThen throw us a little kiss\nAnd then we'll whisper on the mic something real polite\nAnd it goes a little something like this\nWe're the funky four MC's\nWith the hypnotize rhymes that rhyme\nTogether, together\n'Cause the rockin' don't stop when the times\nThose times are better, are better\nThe other MC's that bite our lines\nIn the past present future we'll leave them behind\nWhen will they ever learn the Funky Four MC's are one of a kind?\nYeah, so dip, dive and recreate\nWe're gonna rock this place at a marchin' pace\nJump hop and just keep in step\nAnd check out the MC's got their rep\nWe're the best darn group in the whole wide state\nAnd if you didn't hear us yet ya'll are too late\nWe're the frisco, frisco, brothers disco\nCan't be beat 'cause we rock so sweet\nCan't be stopped 'cause we hit the top\nWe're the voice on the planet\nI know you can't stand it\nTo all the young ladies, don't take for granted\nWe're the dogs through the time, won't make you mine\nWith the rhyme, with the lines all mastermind\nI said the other MC's have the golden voice\nBut we're the ones that you'd made ya' choice\nAnd all we wanna do is make you moist\n'Cause we're not say yes, we're not say no\nBut all you gotta know is that we rock the boat\nNow we're the Funky Four, we rock so well\nIt's easy to see we have the most clientele\nWe rock it slow, we rock it fast\nWe make you rock until you feel the blast\nAnd don't you be enslaved by the people say\nThat we're the whack\n'Cause they're playing with ya head\nAnd

rock to any funky beat\nI'm down by law with rhymes galore\nAnd that why I'm down with the Funky Four\nThese four fly guy don't take no jive\nAnd they'll rock it to your feet\n'Til you can't

limitations to my finesse\nGot the modifications to alterate\nI won't bite the rhyme and I won't imitate\nAnother MC when he's running down rhymes\n'Cause half the time he's just running down mine\nBut that's all right because I know someday\nI'll put him in check and take his rep away\nBecause my name is know from land to land\n'Cause I'm a super fly guy with the mic in my hand\nMy name is known from sea to sea\nAnd when I'm on the mic I cause modern history\nI'm a mystic, magical man on the mic\nWhen I run down a rhyme it'll be a delight\n'Cause I'm a mean machine, a master plan\nYou see what I mean when there's a mic in my hand\n'Cause I'm an inspiration all over the nation\nI let you know that I'm a disco sensation\nA, rock rock, y'all\nNow I can kick the live on as you folks know\nI can energize the sun to make things grow\nI can harmonize the beat to put you in a trance\nI can hypnotize your feet make you do a strange dance\nI can fantasize your dreams and make em' all come true\nI can magnetize a freak and make her rock with you\nI can terrorize the world in a jazzy way\nI can hospitalize with the words I say\nI'm slick, I'm bad, I'm powerful\nI'm the one and only, the original\nI'm Rodney C, I shock the house\nI'm Lil' Rodney C and I turn it out\nKeith Keith, don't stop\nJust get on ya' mic, just get on ya' mic\nJust get on ya' mic when ya' ready to

dop, ya' rock ya' don't stop\nYa' rock the hip, then ya' rock the hop\nAnd then you rock to the beat and don't you dare stop\nJust rock y'all, you don't stop\nA keep on to the sure shot\n'Cause I fit the name Keith and I said it 2 times\nI picked the long name and started a rhyme\nUp the ladder and onto the tree\nWe're the Funky Four MC and my names Keith Keith\nBefore I'm finished let me say this time\nThat my names Keith and you can say it 2 times\nKeith Keith to the funky beat\nAnd now I was walking down the block all by myself\nI wore pants on my jock 'cause I didn't have a belt\nThe pants I wore was so very nice\nI had money in the pocket with 3 red dice\nI saw this girl and she looked so fine\nI said I looked to what's on my mind\nI went over to talk for a while\nWhen I found out that she had a child\nI mind my business and moved away\nI went to a phone to call a OJ\nThe OJ pulled up to the phone\nIt was dark green with a light green tone\nBefore I'm finished let me tell you straight\nThat the car at the phone was a vicious 98\nI got in and we went for a cruise\nWe stopped at the liquor store to by some booze\nWe jerked around and went 8 blocks back\nAnd I went in the cheeba house to by some black\nWe got so drunk and we got so high\nThat he hit his car and that ended the ride\nWe didn't get hurt, nobody died\nSo come on young ladies and ride, ride, ride\nIn my Mercedes, young ladies\nIf my Mercedes breaks down, because of 1 wheel\nI pick you up in my new Seville\nIn my new Seville, I say do like that\nI pick you up in my Cadillac\nIn my Cadillac I say do the same\nThen forget it, we go by train\nJazzy Jeff, don't stop\nJust turn on ya' mic, just turn on ya' mic\nJust turn on ya' mic when ya ready to rock\n\n[Jazzy Jeff]\nCheck it out y'all and you don't stop\nKeep on to the break of dawn\nKeep on-on to the beak of dawn\nI got a lot of potential, got a lot of class\nWhen I run out of rhymes, I can do it fast\nWhen I run out of rhymes, I can do it the best\nAnd if you don't know who I am, my name is Jazzy Jeff\nBecause my voice is on, my styles on go\nI'm rapping on the mic for the thunderscope\nHow there could never be another with more finesse\nI'm gonna say it like I mean it, I'm Jazzy Jeff\nCheck it out y'all, ya' don't stop\nKeep on to the break of dawn\nIt's a couple of people who we can't please\nBut we're here to rock, shock all the MC's\nWho think there bad and think there good\nWe're gonna rock the house like they wish they could\nSo if ya' think ya' on and got a lot of finesse\nBaby step to the side\nBrother we are the best\nWe're the Funky Four\nWe're the new and improved\nJust take a step back\nWe're coming through\nWe're gonna do it right\nWe're gonna put you in check\nThere's no doubt about it we demand respect\nDon't be afraid, don't let ya heart stop\nAsk anybody they will tell you we rock\n'Cause it's not about game, it's all about fun\nWe came to rock the Funky Four plus One\nI'm the one MC that's who could it be\nThe latest number one nominee\nBecause I got a little rep\nAnd a dangerous style\nI'm above MC's\nI'm on top of the pile\nBecause I rhyme all the time\nI mess with mine\nI make MC's wanna bite my rhyme\nI conceded myself as one of the best\n'Cause I have in store the keys to finesse\nMy rhymes are slick my rhymes are bad\nIt's something other MC's never had\n'Cause when I start to rock I just don't stop\nI said def def rhymes no MC can top\nI said Jeff rock the house\nI'm Jazzy Jeff and I'll turn it out y'all\nSha Rock don't stop\nJust get on ya' mic\nJust get on ya'

won't bite a rhyme, and I won't imitate\nAnother MC when he's running down rhymes\n'Cause half the time he's just running down mine\nBut that's all right because I know someday\nI'll put him in check and take his rep away\nBecause my name is known from land to land\n'Cause I'm a super fly guy with the mic in my hand\nMy name is known from sea to sea\nAnd when I'm on the mic I cause modern history\nI'm a mystical, magical man on the mic\nWhen I run down a rhyme it'll be a delight\n'Cause I'm a mean machine, a master plan\nYou see what I mean when there's a mic in my hand\n'Cause I'm an inspiration all over the nation\nI let you know that I'm a disco sensation\nA, rock rock, y'all\nNow I can crystalize [?]\nAnd I can energize the sun to make things grow\nI can harmonize the beat to

terrorize the world in a jazzy way\nI can hospitalize with the words I say\nI'm slick, I'm bad, I'm powerful\nI'm the one and only, the original\nI'm Rodney C, I shock the house\nI'm Lil' Rodney C and I'll turn it out\nKeith Keith, don't stop\nJust get on your mic, just get on your mic\nJust get on your mic when you're ready to rock\n\n[Verse 12: Keith Keith]\nAnd I hear ya, and I hear ya\nAnd I hear ya, MC Rodney C\nWe gonna rock on the mic and make history\nWith all the fly girls yelling \"Take me\"\nAnd I'm Keith Keith, with all the belief\nI'm better than all the other MCs\nWith K.K Rockwell and  Jazzy Jeff\nLi'l Rodney C, we are the best\n'Cause we got a 99 on the disco test\nWith the girl MC we call the Sha Rock\nShe's here to help us hit the top\nBecause we just can't quit, now we're on the go\nWe're five MCs and we're letting you know\nThat we rock and we don't stop\nAnd I was walking down the block all by myself\nI wore pants on my jock 'cause I didn't have a belt\nThe pants I wore was so very nice\nI had money in the pocket with three red dice\nI saw this girl and she looked so fine\nI stared, I looked, she was on my mind\nI went over to give her a rap\nWhen I found out where she really was at\nThen I mind my business and moved away\nI went to a phone to call an OJ\nThe OJ pulled up to the phone\nIt was dark green with a light green tone\nBefore I'm finished, let me tell you straight\nThat the car at the phone was the vicious 98\nI got in and we went for a cruise\nWe stopped at the liquor store to buy some brew\nWe turned around and went eight blocks back\nAnd I went in the cheeba house to buy some black\nWe got so drunk and we got so high\nThat he hit his car and that ended the ride\nWe didn't get hurt, nobody died\nSo come on young ladies and ride, ride, ride\nIn my Mercedes, young ladies\nIn my Mercedes breaks down, because the one wheel\nI pick you up in my new Seville\nIn my new Seville, I say do like that\nI pick you up in my Cadillac\nIn my Cadillac I say do the same\nThen forget it, we go by train\nJazzy Jeff, don't stop\nJust turn on your mic, just turn on your mic\nJust turn on your mic when you're ready to rock\n\n[Verse 13: Jazzy Jeff]\nCheck it out y'all and you don't stop\nKeep on to the break of dawn\nSay I'm Jazzy Jeff, I am the best\nI can make your body move from right to left\nI can make your body move from left to right\nI can make your body move, I mean, all night\nCheck it out, y'all, and you don't stop\nKeep on to the break of dawn\nI got a lot of potential, got a lot of class\nWhen I run down a rhyme, I can do it fast\nWhen I run down a rhyme, I can do it the best\nAnd have you walkin' out the door, thinkin' Jazzy Jeff\n'Cause my voice is on, my style's on go\nI'm rapping on the mic for the Brothers Disco\nHow there could never be another with more finesse\nI'm gonna say it like I mean it, I'm Jazzy Jeff\nIt's a couple of people we can't please\nBut we're here to rock, shock all the MC's\nWho think they're bad and think they're good\nWe're gonna rock the house like they wish they could\nSo if ya think you're on and got a lot of finesse\nTake a step to the side, brother, we are the best\nWe're the Funky Four, we're the new and improved\nJust take a step back, we're coming through\nWe're gonna do it right, we're gonna put you in check\nThere's no doubt about it, we demand respect\nSo don't be afraid, don't let ya heart stop\nAsk anybody, they'll tell you we rock\n'Cause it's not about game, it's all about fun\nWe came to rock, the Funky Four plus One\nSay Jeff rock the house\nI'm Jazzy Jeff and I'll turn it out now\nSha Rock, don't stop\nJust get on your mic, just get on your mic\nJust get on your mic when you're ready to rock\n\n[Verse 14: Sha Rock]\nWell let's go to work, a-to the go to work\nYou go and go, you go, go, you go\nJust work your body, work, work your body\nBut make sure you don't jerk your body\nThen do it, and then do it\nAnd then, do
