  "plain": "One of the most influential and for a period of time, the best rap group ever. Their influence is rarely recognized due to the fact that they didn\u2019t record a lot of material. At their peak, they only performed at parties as did all other hip-hop acts at the time. Their shows featured rapping, coordinated dancing, and harmonizing. The mastermind behind Cold Crush\u2019s rhymes was Grandmaster Caz. His rhymes schemes and punchlines were revolutionary for the time.\n\nThey started gaining significant attention when they battled Grand Wizard Theodore & The Fantastic 5. At the live show, the Fantastic 5 won the battle due to the group\u2019s showmanship. However, bootleg tapes were released after the show and many people felt that Cold Crush won the battle after hearing the lyrics.\n\nThey were then featured in the movie Wild Style in 1982. The movie was an overview of the hip-hop culture in New York at the time. The Cold Crush Brothers can be seen in all their glory."

    "plain": "A record that doesn\u2019t lack in self-confidence, the Cold Crush Brothers go line-for-line talking about how fly they are, how the ladies love them, and how they don\u2019t care about what other MC\u2019s are doing, because they are here with the new rap style. While these topics do sound similar to the braggadocious rap we hear today, Cold Crush doesn\u2019t talk about how much money they have, but they brag about how good of MC\u2019s they are. This speaks on the times, before rap was mainstream and as embraced as it is today, rap wasn\u2019t about money, but the bars. The rhymes. The groups."

When are you rocking again?\"\nAnd when I'm bopping away, I hear a lot of them say\n\"Damn, I wanna be like the L one day\"\n\n[Verse 11: Grandmaster Caz]\nSo many biting MCs, you're all a pain in my neck, ha\nThey should be sending me your royalty check\nYou just bit my rhymes, didn't pay no tax\nCopied the music from someone else, put it on wax\nI'm mad as hell, cause it's bound to sell\nAnd you be biting what I'm writing, and people can't tell\nYou change it around, disguise the sound\nWith no prior desire to write, that's why I frown\nOn those of you that don't strive to\nBe original and write like the Captain do\nSo put your teeth away, and try someday\nAnd you can quote it, cause I wrote it only yesterday\n\n[Verse 12: Grandmaster Caz, J.D.L., Easy A.D., & Almighty Kay Gee]\n(Fresh!) And unless I miss my guess\nI'm the best, oh yes, because I wrote the test\n(Wild!) Honey child on the top of the pile\nOnce in a while I crack a smile\n(Fly!) Know why? Cause 'til the day I die\nI'll always be the guy you won't pass by\n(Bold!) So cold and so hard to hold\nAnd when they made the Cold Crush, they broke the mold\nHah-huh!\n\n[Outro]\nMan, let's get outta here, it's Miller time\nWord!\nHuh!\nHah!Embed"

At The Dixie Lyrics[Verse 1: J.D.L.]\nBy this tough voice, all the ladies can tell\nThe man on the mic (Is what?), the L, the L\nThe hut, the maker, the heart, the breaker\nOn any stage, I'm the number one flaker\nDo it like this and you will see\nNobody in the place can flake like me\n'Cause I'm the L, baby, baby, the L, baby, baby\nThe one who rocks you all swell, baby, baby\nWell it's '82 and everything is fine\nBut I still got a thought in my mind\nThat do you still listen to an MC rhyme?\nWell if you do (Well I'll bet you too)\nThat a lotta them duck MCs are through\nAnd if you still got money and you wanna bet\nWell I'll bet a hundred dollars I'm not whipped yet\n'Cause I'm the L, L, L, L, the one who rocks so well\nSending all the fly girls to the motel\nSo A.D. (Ha ha), A.D. (Ha ha)\nA.D. (Ha ha), A.D. (Ha ha)\nA.D. (Ha hoo), my throat is sore\nHomeboy, get on the mic with your rhymes galore\n[Verse 2: Supreme Easy A.D.]\nMy goal is the same, I aim for fame\nI don't pop no game (He don't have no dame)\nNever put to shame because I have a brain\nSupreme Easy A.D. is the name that I claim\nNever brag about my crew but you know what we can do\nDon't have no LP, but we're not blue\nOur rhymes are the tools to set the mood\nIf you won't bother us, we won't bother you\nWe're the Cold Crush crew, that's what I said\nAll you wack MCs, get it through your heads\nAs you listen to me speak as I reach my peak\nBecause I never bite a rhyme, I never repeat\nBecause I'm Easy A, going all the way\nKeeping up the funky pace to the break of day\nAnd then you get up, a-then ya get down\n(And rock) And rock to (And rock and rock) and rock to the beat\nSupreme Easy rock all you need\nYou rock to the beat 'cause I'm so sweet\nI'm guaranteed to rock the house and get you out of your seat\nWell I'm Supreme A.D. as you can trust\nRockin' to the funky beat I'm the serious must\nI'm down with the four, I'm down with the four\nI'm down with the four known as the Cold Crush\nThe Cold Crush crew (The what?)\nThe Cold Crush crew (Say what?)\nIs guaranteed to get the party people in the groove (Say what?)\nCold Crush crew got nothin' to prove\nBut rock the house for you and you\nAnd Kay Gee (Ha ha), Kay Gee (Ha ha)\nKay Gee (Ha ha), Kay Gee (Ha ha)\nKay Gee (Ha hoo), my throat is sore\nHomeboy, get on the mic, get on the mic goddammit\nGet on the mic with your rhymes galore\nYou might also like[Verse 3: The Almighty Kay Gee]\nYes, yes y'all (Yes y'all)\nYes, yes y'all (Yes y'all)\nYou know that the Four is fresh y'all (Fresh y'all)\nYou do it up and then you get on down\n'Cause the Cold Crush Four is in your town\nWell I'm the K, the K, the K, the K\nAnd don't forget the A\nRock to the beat to the break of day\nAnd rock to the beat and listen to what I say\nWalkin' down the street and I met this girl\nTold the girl what it's gonna be\nLet's go to my house and community\nThen I hit her with a rap that was so bad\nI took the girl up to my pad\nGot home, she start buggin' on me\nI said to myself \"I know this can't be\"\nThe girl turned around and then she broke\nAnd I just laughed like it was some kind of joke\n(She said) Baby be calm, (She said) baby be cool\nLet me teach you the golden rule\nBut yes my mellow do y'know what I said? (What?)\nLaid her monkey ass (What?), shoved her monkey ass (What?)\nThrew her monkey ass in my waterbed\nI said Caz, my mell-ow\nGet on the mic and serve 'em well\n[Verse 4: Grandmaster Caz]\nIt was a long time ago but I'll never forget\nI got caught in the bed with a girl named Yvette\nWell I was scared like hell but I got away\nThat's why I'm here tellin' you today\nI was outside of my school sniffing up some rocks\nA crowd of people all around listenin' to my box\nJust me and the fans, and some guys from my crew\nChillin' hard 'cause we had nothin' better to do\nIt was me, the L, the A, and the All\nAnd then I slipped away to make a phone call\nTo this very day it was a move I regret\nBut I didn't know then so I called Yvette\nI said, \"Hello pretty mama, it's your lover man\"\nShe said, \"Baby, come on over as quick as you can\"\nI said, \"I can't come now, someone's comin' to get me\"\nThen she said, \"I'm all alone, there's nobody with me\"\nThought for a second, \"Oh shit, she's alone!\"\nThen I was knockin' at her door 'fore she hung up the phone\nShe let me in the house and gave me a kiss\nAnd said, \"Give me that thing that you know I missed\"\nAnd so we went into her room and we got high\nBut she couldn't keep her hand from off my fly\nSo I made her lock the door, went to check it\nWhen I came back in the girl was naked\nThat was my cue to do the do\nI took my clothes off and started on the pooh\nWell I was tearin' shit up, then 'bout a quarter to three\nShe said, \"Caz! Somebody's comin'!\"\nI said, \"Yeah, me!\"\nThen the door bust open, and there was her folks\nI thought, \"Damn, they coulda waited - said damn, they coulda waited, said damn, they coulda waited 'til I finished my strokes\"\nHer mother was in shock, her father reached on the shelf\nPulled down a .45, I almost shit on myself!\nSaid, \"Please don't shoot!\" and pleaded my case\nSaid, \"You'd have done the same thing if you was in my place\nBut if you spare my life, believe me friend!\nYou'll never see me 'round your daughter again\"\nDon't ask me why but he let me leave\nI ran 26 blocks, then I stopped to breathe\nGave thanks to God he wasn't too upset\nWent home and thought about poor Yvette\nHe must of beat her ass with everything I assume\n'Cause I could hear the girl screamin' all the way in my room\nEven though I don't see Yvette no more\nWell I know she ain't as fine, I know she ain't as fine\nI know ain't half as fine as she was before\nSo J.D.L. ha, you know my voice is sore\nHomeboy, get on the mic and rock once more\n\n[Verse 5: J.D.L.]\nWell I'm here to be known and I'm known to be\nAs an electrifying prince of poetry\nYou listen to my rhymes that you never ever heard\nSo stick around...2Embed"

   "lyrics": "Weekend Lyrics[Intro]\nEverybody listen to this\nThe weekend's coming so don't you dare miss\nYou're gonna regret if you're not on the scene\nAnd then you'll get so mad it'll make you scream\n\n[Verse 1]\nEveryone give us your attention please\nEspecially those of you who like parties\nIt's a message that we would like to extend\nAbout why everybody love the what? Weekend!\nCause there's a time to work and a time to play\nBut you can't do both effectively in one day\nSo without delay, without further ado\nLet the four run down this week for you\nWe're the Cold Crush Four, giving, giving you more\nAnd we just came to say\nOooh-ahh, what a relief it is\nWhen the weekend comes your way\nSo grab a chair from anywhere\nAnd listen while we speak\nCause the Four's gonna start this record off\nWith the first day of the week\n[Verse 2]\nMonday!\nThe train was late and you hardly ate\nPlus you wish you'd stayed in bed\nTuesday!\nYou ran a game on your favorite dame\nAnd then she messed up your head\nWednesday!\nYou try to be cool and stay out of school\nYeah, you're fronting and showboating\nThursday!\nNow your mind's in doubt, you can't figure out\nWhy you're not gonna get promoted\nFriday!\nAfter work is through, you sleep for a few\nUntil you hear somebody say\n\"Wake up, wake up, now don't you know\nThe weekend's when we play\"\n\nThis is Chase with the bass\nTone, leave the girl alone\n\n[Verse 3]\nFriday and Saturday night, everybody's gonna show\nAt the place where all the fly people go\nYou been working at school or your occupation\nNow it's about time for some recreation\nSlip on your shirt and designer jeans\nSay the ones that are tight at the hip and the seams\nThen you shoot out the door like you're running a race\nAnd then you finally arrive at the Cold Crush place\nAnd...\nYou might also like[Verse 4]\nYou can't believe your eyes, 'cause\nThe party's packed and jumping\nThat funky bass is thumping\nAnd the way the music rocks your mind\nOoh girl, it's really something\nIt's a place where you can dance\nYou can even find romance\nAnd I know you can do it if you\nGive yourself a chance\nSo-so-so-so, so just dance\n\nAlmighty all nighty, ha ha ha\nJDL, well...\n\n[Verse 5]\nWe gonna let you know, we gonna let you see\nWhat we're gonna do at the party\nGrandmaster Caz, I got lovin' to spare\nI'm gonna chill with the ladies when I get there\nWell I'm Jerry Dee or JDL\nAnd when I get there I'm gonna rock it well\nEasy AD not talkin' no jive\nAnd the party's gonna swing when I arrive\nWell I'm the Almighty and when I get there\nI wanna hear everybody cheer, cheer, cheer\nAnd we're the Cold Crush Four\nWith Tone and Chase\nSo c'mon everybody in the party place\nJust throw your hands in the air\nAnd just wave them like you just don't care\nAnd if you're on the go cause we told you so\nSomebody say Hoooo (Hooo!)\nHooo-hoooo! (Hoooo-hooo!)\nHo-ho-ho! (Ho-ho-ho!)\n[Verse 6]\nNow the lights are flashin', the people are dancing\nThe guys are looking out for some serious action\nIt's richer than a diamond, finer than a pearl\nAnd this is what happens when boy meets girl\nIntroduce yourself as whoever you are\nThen you grab her by the hand and lead her to the bar\nOffer her a drink, maybe a cigarette\n'Til she insists conversation is all you're gonna get\nTry another approach and ask her for a dance\nYour time is runnin' out, this is your last chance\nAnd then you sweep her off her feet with your prowess\nAnd then you know you got it made \u2014 finally, success\nCause we rock the best and the Four is fresh\n\n[Interlude]\nOooh man that party was smokin'...\n[TALKING - NEEDS TRANSCRIPTION]\n\n[Verse 7]\nWhen the jam is over you head for the stairs\nAll the girls and the guys are leaving in pairs\nYou had such a good time, you wish you could stay\nNow it's time to catch the bus, train, or OJ\nYou get to your house and pull out your key\nYou're tired as hell, you want to sleep 'til three\nWake up Sunday, wipe the sleep from your eyes\nAnd go out in the sun for some exercise\nPlay ball, roller skate, or visit a friend\nAnd go home and think about the next weekendEmbed"

Somebody's comin'!\"\nI said, \"Yeah, me!\"\nThen the door bust open, and there was her folks\nI thought, \"Damn, they coulda waited 'til I finished my strokes\"\nHer mother was in shock, her father reached on the shelf\nPulled down the .45, I almost shit on myself!\nSaid, \"Please don't shoot!\" and pleaded my case\nSaid, \"You'd have done the same thing if you was in my place\nBut if you spare my life, believe me friend!\nYou'll never see me 'round your daughter again\"\nDon't ask me why but he let me leave\nI ran 37 blocks, then I stopped to breathe\nGave thanks to God he wasn't too upset\nAnd went home and thought about poor Yvette\nHe must of beat her ass with everything I assume\n'Cause I could hear the girl screamin' all the way in my room\nEven though I don't see Yvette no more\nI know she ain't as fine as she was before\nIt's like that (That y'all)\nYou might also likeYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah\nY'all gotta excuse us... See, we wanna\u2014 we can't, we can't bounce as much as we want to 'cause if we bounce too much the record will jump you know, so we gotta be a little stiff, don't mind that. We would like if everybody could move, like, y'know, up close up here, but... so we can like step up there, you know what I'm saying? [?] But thank y'all anyway, we appreciate it. That's enough [?], right? Alright. No light? No light?\nAlright, tell you what. (Yeah.) Huh? Don't worry about it, it's okay, everything's fine. (Everything's fine baby.) (One two, one two.) How's everybody feeling in the Danceteria tonight?\nYeah, come on, make some noise every-goddamn-body...Embed"

A Hip-Hop History) Lyrics[Verse 1: All]\n...Hey, you better abide\nWhile we rock your ass on the solo side\nGrandmaster Caz, you are the Cap\nSo get on the mic and show 'em you're the lord of rap\n\n[Verse 2: Grandmaster Caz & All]\nWell I'm the Cap of the Four, MC exec\nAnd I don't come at all if it ain't correct\nDon't have to bite, not necessary\nThe Grandmaster Caz got a rhyme library\nRhyme from now until the break of day\nDon't have a big mouth, just a lot to say\nSo if you run out of rhymes, start sounding dumb\nCome see me, me, me, G.M.C\nI am the Captain of the Four\nAnd I'm guaranteed to sell you some\nA-Duracell J.D.L., you're the number one flaker\nGet on the mic and show 'em that you're the hut maker\n[Verse 3: J.D.L. & All]\nYou hear my, you hear my, you hear my, you hear my\nYou hear my, you hear my, you hear my, you hear my\nYou hear my voice on cassettes and on 8-track\nNext step is to have it put on wax\nOn the radio station to make the jam sell\nI came to you again on WJDL\nDoing worldwide tours, TV of course\nPlus my own line of products which I endorse\nFinancial clout, a piece of the rock\nAnd 600 shares, 6,000 shares, 6,000,000 shares of IBM stock\nNow Easy A.D., making your girl scream\nGet on the mic and show 'em why you're Supreme\n\n[Verse 4: Easy A.D. & All]\nI'm girl-taker A.D. at the top of the chart\nI'm not a thief but known to steal your heart\nWon't be too long before I'm seen\nIn the cover of Life Magazine\n'Cause I can see it in your eyes when I start rappin'\nYou know I'm the man that makes things happen\nFurthermore, if you want company\nHere's my number and a dial so you can call me\nAnd Almighty Kay Gee, you're the last, not least\nSo get on the microphone and speak your piece\nYou might also like[Verse 5: Almighty Kay Gee]\nI don't beat around the bush (What?) and I don't stall\nAnd when you say Kay Gee, you said it all\nIf you don't know by now, you should've been told\nWhen they made the Almighty, I broke the mold\nRob from the rich, give to the poor\nPlus I snatch a few dollars for the Cold Crush Four\nAlmighty, I'm down with the best\nAnd if you don't like me, I wouldn't care less, so\n\n[Verse 6: All]\nCalling a truce and raise a flag\nThere ain't an MC crew that we can't rag\nNow we got two records, and been on tour...Embed"

Boy, we be doing fine\nWe be sippin' on Moet while you're sucking on a lemon or lime\nAs my record's being played on prime time\nAll you wack imitators, get off mine\nAnd feel the horns!\n\n[Chorus]\nFeel the horns!\nFeel the horns!\nFeel the horns!\n\n[Verse 3]\nJust like a consumer, I'm gonna consume\nAll you fake rap thugs in just one room\nAnd when I feel great I like to calculate\nOn a large sum of words that's hard to duplicate\n'Cause I'm rated great, don't have a gold plate\nNever need to perpetrate, and your girl she be waiting\nAt a quarter to eight, 'cause I'm a living legend\nA gladiator to those who oppose [?]\nIn front of me they dare to throw blows\n'Cause I'm equivalent to thunder soul, writing is zap\nMy rhyme is automatic boy, as swift as a cat\nSo all you fake imitators stop sweating on my back\nAnd feel the horns!\nYou might also like[Chorus]\nFeel the horns!\nFeel the horns!\nFeel the horns!\n\n[Verse 4]\nMy mind is a computer, uh! I'm on a mission\nHopin' and wishin' for better competition\nBut there's none, uh! 'Cause I'm the only one\nWho can do damage to the beat of a drum\nSo let the sun be upon you, and let it shine bright\n'Cause I'm the AWL and my voice is like a laser light\nI've been rocking Hip hop ever since it was born\nSo all you fake imitators feel the horns!\nFeel the horns!\n\n[Chorus]\nFeel the horns!\nFeel the horns!\nFeel the horns!\n\nThe everlasting horns\n\n[Outro]\nI'd like to say to my man Tony Crush in the house, and homeboy Henry, and Nico\nYou know what I'm saying? Engineer, my man Shamrock, and Captain Cool DEmbed"

   "lyrics": "Heartbreakers (Party Mix) Lyrics[Verse 1: Grandmaster Caz, J.D.L., Supreme Easy A.D., Almighty Kay Gee]\nNumber one with the fun\nNumber two with the cue\nI'm number three can't you see\nI'm number\u2005four\u2005at your door\nWith\u2005a rap so fresh that the\u2005rest confess\nThat to mess with the best you have to be possessed\nSo just go, start, proceed, begin\nAnd let the Cold Crush four tell you something\nTurn off the TV and your HBO\nBecause the four came back to make you say \"Ho\"\nPut down that book and your magazine\nAnd let the Crush show you something that you've never seen\nIt's not a joke, no riddle, just plain old fun\n'Cause we're four good things roll\u0435d up in one\nHere to turn it out lik\u0435 we always do\nHere's the new run-ins for you and your crew\nIf you can dig it deal with it\nIf you can't just forget it\n'Cause nobody rocks a party like the Cold Crush\n[Verse 2: Grandmaster Caz]\nNew jacks and rap rookies and sucker MCs\nBow down to the lord, drop to your knees\n'Cause chill time is over, mister nice guy's gone\nAnd everybody's getting put in check from now on\nFrom the top to the bottom, I'm checking my file\nEverybody get a lawyer, you're all on trial\nAnd if you're found guilty you'll have to answer to me\n'Cause I'm the judge, prosecutor and the jury\nIs made up of those who've proven themselves able\nWe all sit down at the rap round table\nPreside over the masses, enforce the laws\nIf we decide to call you out you better go for yours\nFrom this day forth, defeat if you live a lie\nNow marks the return of Casanova Fly\nKing of the crab, giving y'all the shab\nGet your giggles out now, I got the last laugh\nHaha, haha, ha, ha, (Sucker, sucker, suck-, suck-)\nJ.D.L. L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L!\n\n[Verse 3: J.D.L.]\nI got a hard act that's hard to follow\nMy name is J.D.L., you call me rhyme-tholo-\nGist and I insist that you watch this\nOn my fist won't miss where you kiss, homepiss\nI've paid my dues and done my time\nPlus any rhyme I design is mine all mine\nSo if you're down in the dumps or in a rut\nDon't try to get out for biting on my hut\n'Cause I'm the L, what the hell, but don't you tell\nNext time you want to bite on the mic 'cause you like\nNext time you want to bite, ring another brother's bell\nAD, D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D!\nYou might also like[Verse 4: Supreme Easy A.D.]\nSupreme Easy A.D., the cream of the crop\nThe emcee that people just love to jock\nWhen I'm on the stage I'll let you know\nThat the taker is the one who runs the show\nI'm as wise as an owl, as free as a slave\nI've been rapping for eight years, still haven't got paid\nBut you see me fly, as sharp as can be\nTake a feel, I'm real, girl-taker A.D\nPeople smile in my face but I never smile back\nThe Sucker MC's are the two that wear black\nYour clothes are old, you're weak and whack\nSo get a pen and I'll lend a professional rap\nI'm real, not fake, as slick as a snake\nI'll chew you up and spit you out like a piece of cake\nTurn fire to smoke, give your mother a stroke\nAnd have a girl two years going to both[?]\nI wrote a rhyme for you and your man too\nWhen you talk about the Crush your careers are through\nWe're fresh, wild, fly and bold\nWe didn't start in '82, we started six years ago\nKay Gee, G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G-G!\n\n[Verse 5: Almighty Kay Gee]\nWhile you was home picking with your toes\nI was rocking with the baddest brothers in disco\nWhere the people were fresh, everyone getting down\nRocking to the rhythm of the funky sound\nSaid I walk down the street, people on my jock\nBecause I'm the Almighty walking through your block\nHold up my man, don't you know\nAlmighty Kay Gee's name is worth more than gold\nNow I'm here to patrol, but you better behold\n'Cause the Almighty Kay Gee is taking control\nI feel it in my soul, I got a good toll\nTo rock hip hop 'til I'm 90 years old\nChilling on my throne, keeping girls on my bone\nAnd still be rapping on the microphone\nIf you don't know the game of survival\nI said my man you had best to chill\nThe way I rock the mic, the way we stomp on the floor\nYour mother, your brother, and your pa\nYeah, everybody calling us the Cold Crush four\nBreak, break, break, breaker\n\n[Verse 6: Grandmaster Caz & All]\nI'm Caz, so what, what does that mean?\nYou make me feel like this girl, nothing else will do\nSo don't blame me because I want to freak you\nIt's not 'cause I'm nasty or a sex maniac\nI want to be the one that sends a chill up your back\nWe'll start out with a show, some dinner and wine\nAnd if there are any staring at you, they must be blind\nAnd we can both step off or we can be cozy\n'Cause that will be the time to get freaky\nGirl, I can do it to you until you start to purr\nIce, whipped cream, or honey, whatever you prefer\nWaterbed, on the floor, in the tub, on the couch\nWhen it comes to being freaky I ain't no slouch\nI'm on a mission from G-O-D\nTo make you women feel sexy\nSo don't think you ain't 'cause I'll make you faint\nSo far I've never got one complaint\nIt won't never hurt because I'm a sexpert\nFirst take off your sweater and drop your skirt\nAnd as I'm slipping out of my leather clothes\nYou can start removing them pantyhose\nWe'll sit some more, watch HBO\nHit some nitro and then I'll go\nFrom head to toe licking that snow\nAbove your torso and down below\nI'll make you scream and release the cream\nThrill you beyond your wildest dream\nTingle your flesh 'til you say yes\n\"Oh Caz, you give it to me the best\"\n\nBreak, break, break, breaker\n\n[Verse 7: J.D.L. & All]\nI'm J.D.L., big deal, what does that prove?\nI got impeccable taste and a certain flair\n'Cause when I walk in a room you know I'm there\nDon't act conceited or brag out loud\nBut everywhere I go I seem to draw a crowd\nGot a lot of friends, a lot of enemies too\nThey hate my guts because of what I do\nTwist up my words, change what I say\nThey don't understand I just came to play\nSo if you coming rowdy, do me a favor\nJust be on your best behavior\n\n[Verse 8: Easy A.D. & All]\nEasy, Easy who, and what is your game?\nI'm never rotten, always right when I'm on the mic\nBecause you see perfection is in my sight\nPlay no roles, got goals, soon to behold\nDon't think I'm fly, don't get high but manage to get by\nNever fret or frown, can't take away my crown\nThe bite or the beats 'cause the water's boiling now\nToo hot I'll make you bop when I rocked the spot\nHit the top of the charts when I flow you're hot\nGive me a smile or a grin, I have no friends\nBut the Cold Crush four all the way to the end\n\n[Verse 9: Almighty Kay Gee & All]\nKay Gee, that's your business, now what you got to say\nI can rock you any time, anywhere, any day\nI'm-a tell you a little story all about me\nHow I began to be the Almighty, huh\nStarted out with nothing then to gain\nNow look at my name in the hall of fame\nWhile I look at you rapping and look at the shame\nBecause I'm rapping on the mic, not playing no game\nThe All, All, All, the one who went too tall\nRapping on the mic like I play basketball\nShoot the ball right in the hoop\nAs the Cold Crush four start to get loose\n\n[Verse 10: Grandmaster Caz]\nWell it's me, the prince of power, the deacon of dance\nSole heir to the throne of the king of romance\nThe duke of devastation, the rapper royal\nMaestro on the mic, innovator of style\nShepherd of the flock, the punk in your rock\nA one man corporation, you better buy stock\nNot white or Hispanic, just a rhyme mechanic\nGuaranteed to make you boogie, there's no need to panic\nDig the clothes I'm in, when you see me you'll grin\nThe Captain is constantly surrounded by the fly women\nAnd if it's not known yet, then let it be discovered\nThat when it comes to rhymes I got all the bases covered\nAny subject, object, place, or time\nI take into consideration when I write my rhymes\nThat's why I can say very easily\nThat the Cold Crush four are the b-e-s-t\nB-e-s-t (in the whole world)\nB-e-s-t (Haha ha)\nB-e-s-t\nB-e-s-t\nFor the rest of my life 'til the day I die\n'Cause I'm the Grandmaster Caz and you know I\nAm right, polite, really good in the night\nAnd the chances that I'm not are less than slight\nSo give it up, give it, give it, give it on up\nBecause we got the rap and Chase got the cut\n\nBass, bass, bassEmbed"

(Ahhhhhh!)\nHa-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!\nHa-ha-ha-ha-ha!\nHa-ha-ha-ha!\nHa-ha-ha!\n\n[Verse 1]\nParis-ris-ris,\u2005I wanna do it like this\nAnd New York-York-York, where the people like to talk\nAnd L-L-L.A., where they love to play\nAnd then Ro-Ro-Rome, they get rockin' in their home\nAnd D.C-C-C., where the people boogie\nWhat about Fran-Fran-France, well they love to dance\n[Verse 2]\nIt's the Cold Crush Four, telling you the word\nSo ignore that other stuff you heard\nIt's the truth for the youth and it ain't no lie\nAnd if you say that it is, we hope you die\nYou couldn't hold us down with a ball and chain\nThe sleet and snow couldn't stop us, neither can the rain\nBecause we always go forth, through thick or thin\nAnd if you're betting on the Brothers, you're a cinch to win\nNow you can rhyme all night 'til your throat is sore\nAnd you can talk that stuff 'til you can't no more\nAnd if you askin' for a battle, we start a war\nBecause that's what you get for messing with the Cold Crush Four\nWith that one-on-one, rock any MC pup\nAnd all hell breaks loose when we team up\nYou say ashes to ashes and dust to dust\nWe are the brothers, don't ask the Cold Crush! (Crush, Crush, Crush, Crush...)\n\n[Bridge]\nSay mate, you heard that new dance, the Way Bout?\n\nShake it to the left, shake it to the right\nShake it to the left, shake it to the right\nAnd move it to the front, and bring it to the back\nAnd move it to the front, and bring it to the back\nAnd then you pump it, pump it, pump it, pump it\nPump it, pump it, pump it, pump it!\nYou might also like[Refrain 1]\nI feel it in the Tone, I've got to move my bone\nI feel it in the Tone, I've got to move my bone\nI feel it in the Tone, I've got to move my bone\nI feel it in the Tone, I've got to move my bone\nI said I feel it in the Tone, I've got to move my bone\nI said I feel it in the Tone, I've got to move my bone\nMove-move my bone\nGot to move my bone\n\n[Refrain 2]\nTu-Tu-Tu-Tu-Tuff City, make you nitty-gritty\nTuff, Tuff, Tuff City, make you nitty-gritty\nTu-Tu-Tu-Tu-Tuff City, make you nitty-gritty\nTu-Tu-Tu-Tu-Tuff City, make you nitty-gritty\n\n[Interlude]\n\u00bfHola? (\u00bfHola?)\nAj\u00e1, \u00bfa qui\u00e9n busca?\nNo, no, no, no\nAqu\u00ed ellos no... ellos no viven aqu\u00ed\nEste es la ciudad de Cold Crush Brothers\nNo le pertenece a nadie m\u00e1s, nada m\u00e1s a los Cold Crush Brothers\n\u00bfEntiende? Muchas gracias\n\n[Outro]\nTo the Disco Fever, pick up on this\nThe Red Parrot, pick up on this\nAnd Broadway, pick up on this\nAnd Zanzibar, pick up on this\nTo the Mudd Club, haha ha, pick up on this\nAnd to the Gara-haha, pick up on this\nTo Ecstacy, ah haha haha, pick up on this\nTo the Copa', pick up on this\nTo the Fun House, haha ha, pick up on this\nCe-Celebrity Club, woo! Pick up on this\nPick up on this\nPick up on this\nPick up on this\nPick up on this\nTo the Elegante, pick up on this\nAnd to Ritz, Ritz, Ritz, pick up on this\nPick up on this\nPick up on this\nTo Xenon's, pick up on th\u2014Embed"

L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L-L!\n\n[Verse 7: J.D.L.]\nI got impeccable taste and a certain flair\n'Cause when I walk in a room people know I'm there\nDon't act conceited or brag out loud\nEverywhere I go I seem to draw a crowd\nGot a lot of friends, a lot of enemies too\nThey hate my guts because of what I do\nTwist up my words and change what I say\nThey don't understand I just came to play\nSo if you coming rowdy, do me a favor\nAnd just be on your best behavior\n\n[Grandmaster Caz & J.D.L.]\nA.D. D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D!\n\n[Verse 8: Easy A.D.]\nI'm never rotten, always right when I'm on the mic\n[?] and perfection is in my sight\nPlay no roles, got goals, soon to behold\nDon't think I'm fly, don't get high but manage to get by\nNever fret, never frown, can't take away my crown\nDivide up the beans 'cause the water's boiling now\nToo hot, I made you rock when I rocked the spot\nHit the top of the charts when I flow you're hot\nGive me a smile or a grin, I have no friends\nBut the Cold Crush Four all the way to the end\n\n[Verse 9: Grandmaster Caz, J.D.L., Supreme Easy A.D., & All]\nG.M.C., all the ladies love me\nJ.D.L., everybody know I rock it well\nEasy A.D., to-to the funky beat\nAnd Kay Gee, baby doll, that's the Almighty\nSo we want every, we want every\nWe want every, we want every\nWe want everybody to get up and move your butt\nBecause the Four is on the microphone and Chase and Tone is on the cut\nSo don't try to play high post and think you got a lot of class\n'Cause it's Kay Gee, A.D., the L, the L\nAnd me, Grandmaster Caz\nHuh, huh, huh!\n\n[Outro: Simultaneous Conversations]Embed"
