   "lyrics": "I really don\u2019t know what constitutes for \u201crelevant\u201d coverage in HIP-HOP news in America these days, but I really want to give you all a heads up. As you know I\u2019ve been through three passports, 76 countries on the regular in the name of Hip-Hop since 1987 and in 2010, although I\u2019ve never stopped traveling the earth this year, I\u2019ve seen, heard and felt some new things\n\nAs far as RAP and HIP-HOP, it\u2019s like USA Olympic basketball, the world has parity now and have surpassed the USA in ALL of the basic fundamentals of HIP-HOP \u2013 TURNTABLISM, BREAKING, GRAFFITI, and now EMCEEING with succinct mission , meaning and skill. Skill-wise rappers spitting three languages, have created super rappers to move the crowd with intensity and passion. The \u201carrogant\u201d American comes in blackface, but if there was a HIP-HOP or Rap Olympics, I really don\u2019t think the United States would get Gold, Silver or Brass or even ass for that sake\n\nPersonally, Public Enemy has been setting records in a record book that doesn\u2019t really exist. The 20th year anniversary of FEAR OF A BLACK PLANET has become into a year and a half celebration of eights legs and five continents. All the while, looking at a HIP-HOP Planet across 25 countries while still somewhat supportive of American rap, the rest of the world has surpassed the U.S. in skill, in fundamentals and commitment to their communities. Public Enemy\u2019s mission is to set the path, pave the road for cats to do their thing for a long time as long as they do it right\n\nBecause of the lack of support from local radio, television and community in the United States, the ability for \u201clocal\u201d acts to thrive in their own radius has killed the ability to connect and grow into a proper development as a performer, entertainer and artist. Rappers trying to get put on to a national contract hustle from a NEW YORK or LOS ANGELES corporation has caused the art-form to atrophy from the bottom, while never getting signed to a top echelon that really doesn\u2019t exist, but to a very few\n\nHIP-HOP NEWS spreads like any other mainstream NEWS in America. The garbage that\u2019s unfit to print has now floated on websites and blogs like sh*t. For example a rapper working in the community gets obscured while if that same rapper robbed a gas station he\u2019d get top coverage and be label a \u201crapper\u201d while getting his upcoming or current music somewhat put on blast, regardless of its quality which of course is subjective like any other art. RAP sites and blogs are mimicking the New York POST\n\nThis is not mere complaint , this is truth and its coming down on Americans like rain without a raincoat with cats screaming how they ain\u2019t wet. This is real. The other night upon finishing groundbreaking concert performances in Johannesburg we followed a special free concert in Soweto. To make a point that our agenda was to \u201cshow? and encourage the Hip-Hop community to be comfortable in its mind and skin without chasing valueless Amerikkkan values\n\nNever have so many been pimped by so few\n\nIt does the people of the planet little good to hear that an an artist is famous and rich, will wear expensive jewelry straight from the mines, show it off, stay it the hotel, ride in limos, do the VIP with chilled champagne in the clubs, ape and monkey the chicks (meaning not even talking) and keep the dudes away with slave paid bodyguards when real people come close. The mimic of the VIACOM-sanctioned video has run tired, because it shows off, does NOT inspire and it says NOTHING\n\nHere in South Africa PUBLIC ENEMY has done crucial groundbreaking performances. Its the same level of smashing the house that we\u2019ve done this year in Moscow, New York, Paris, London , Chicago and other places this year. This is not news We are not trying to prove any point other than to show that a classic work is timeless and doesn\u2019t have a demographic per se. The Rolling Stones and U2 are NOT measured by mere tracks\u2019 they are measured by the all-around event they present. The art of the performance has left Hip-Hop whereas somebody has led artists to do more performing off the stage than on it. The agenda here is to create artist exchange\n\nThis serves as a call to the infrastructure-less Hip-Hop game in Amerikkka. We know what your hustle is, but what is your work and job here? Faking it until making it runs its course in a recession, which is a depression for Black folks who increasingly are becoming more skill-less as they become jobless\n\nNever have so many been pimped by so few\n\nSince the music has so much power, and image has become everything to the point that it can dictate the direction of a person in their life\n\nIt is my mission now to really become a \u201cfreedom fighter\u201d and stop this radiation. With Jay-Z and others who, for years would faint their worth, the statement of \u201cwith great power comes great responsibility,\u201d is more true. Words are powerful and they can both start wars and bring peace. This cannot be taken lightly. Its important for the words to be body with the community. If not one dime of $250 million doesn\u2019t benefit the people who contribute to it then why does that warrant coverage above the will and effort of many in the music who have done great things\nNever have so many been pimped by so few\n\nI turned 50 this year. Everyday I get the question whats up with Hip-Hop today. If nothing was wrong the question wouldn\u2019t be the dominating question I get. I do massive interviews worldwide. I\u2019m covered from varied aspects Hip-Hop, Public Enemy, social issues, musicology in general. So, my interactive world dialogue is deeper and more present than 140 characters\n\nNever have so many been pimped by so few\n\nI am tired of the silence of people that know better. There is nothing worse than a person that knows better and does worse. Or says nothing\n\nAnd makes excuses for bulls**t\n\nYou know damn well HIP-HOP in the USA has fell way the fuck off as the American dollar and much of America itself. Held up and dictated by White business lawyers, accountants in New York, and Los Angeles offices\n\nTo dictate to a community and not even live or be with the people is offensive. VIACOMs reach into Africa to turn HIP-HOP in to Amerfrica, which is as exploitative as those slave-makers who carried us across on boats. The decisions made in a boardroom in New York City while these cats scurry to their high rises, and suburban mansions from cultural profiteering must stop. And I\u2019m going to do something about it\n\nNever have so many been pimped by so few\n\nMy agenda of Hip-Hop around the world is in line with its creators, who followed Black Music. The music had the people\u2019s back. It has never been my personal agenda. Americans arrogantly have no back. Hip-Hop has followed this. I am disturbed by the fact that I tell artists that doing work in their community will get them little or no buzz for their effort, but in the same sense if they robbed or shot someone or did a bid they would get national and sometimes international attention\n\nNever have so many been pimped by so few\n\nSo many of your favorite people suck up to the NBA and NFL, because it has order and when you make the game look bad David Stern or Robert Goddell is kicking their asses out . They are the indisputable HWIC, and negroes are in line and silenced. But here in Hip-Hop the dysfunctionality reward makes the money that puts food on many tables\n\nIts time, because I hear too many excuses. I won't allow what\u2019s in the USA f**k up what I and others worked hard to instill. I drive a \u201994 Montero, a \u201997 Acura, and have no expensive jewelry. There is nothing on this planet materially that is better than myself. This is what I instill in many doing Hip-Hop that nothing is greater than what is given. These games of people doing anything to get things has seeped into my way so therefore witness some radical virtual things coming from me in protecting the art-form of Hip-Hop\n\nNever have so many been pimped by so few\nSo, I\u2019m going after the few\n\nI\u2019m tired of it\n\nChuck D from CaPEtown, South Africa\n\nPublic Enemy\u2019s 71st Tour\n\n6th Leg of a Fear Of A Black Plan Tour1EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

   "description": {
    "plain": "Jan Brewer\u2019s decision to sign the Arizona immigration bill into law is racist, deceitful, and reflects some of the most mean-spirited politics against immigrants that the country has ever seen. The power that this law gives to police, to detain people that they suspect to be undocumented, brings racial profiling to a new low. Brewer\u2019s actions and those of Joe Arpaio, Russell Pearce, the Arizona State Senate are despicable, inexcusable, and endorse the all-out hate campaign that Joe Arpaio, Russell Pearce, and others have perpetrated upon immigrants for years. The people of Arizona who voted for this bill, as well as those who crafted it, demonstrate no regard for the humanity or contributions of Latino people. And for all of those who have chosen not to speak up, shame on you for silently endorsing this legislated hate.\nIn 1991 I wrote a song criticizing Arizona officials (including John McCain and Fife Symington) for rejecting the federal holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The same politics I wrote about in \u201cBy the Time I Get to Arizona\u201d are alive and well in Arizona today, but this time the target is Brown people.\nThese actions must stop. I am issuing a call to action, urging my fellow musicians, artists, athletes, performers, and production companies to refuse to work in Arizona until officials not only overturn this bill, but recognize the human rights of immigrants. This should include the NBA playoffs, revisiting the actions of the NFL in 1993, when they moved the Superbowl to Pasadena in protest against Arizona\u2019s refusal to recognize Dr. King. We all need to speak up in defense of our brothers and sisters being victimized in Arizona, because things are only getting worse. What they\u2019re doing to immigrants is appalling, but it will be even more damning if we remain silent.\n(A statement released by Chuck D and his wife, Dr. Gaye Theresa Johnson; here\u2019s the source.)"

       "plain": "Jan Brewer\u2019s decision to sign the Arizona immigration bill into law is racist, deceitful, and reflects some of the most mean-spirited politics against immigrants that the country has ever seen. The power that this law gives to police, to detain people that they suspect to be undocumented, brings racial profiling to a new low. Brewer\u2019s actions and those of Joe Arpaio, Russell Pearce, the Arizona State Senate are despicable, inexcusable, and endorse the all-out hate campaign that Joe Arpaio, Russell Pearce, and others have perpetrated upon immigrants for years. The people of Arizona who voted for this bill, as well as those who crafted it, demonstrate no regard for the humanity or contributions of Latino people. And for all of those who have chosen not to speak up, shame on you for silently endorsing this legislated hate.\nIn 1991 I wrote a song criticizing Arizona officials (including John McCain and Fife Symington) for rejecting the federal holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The same politics I wrote about in \u201cBy the Time I Get to Arizona\u201d are alive and well in Arizona today, but this time the target is Brown people.\nThese actions must stop. I am issuing a call to action, urging my fellow musicians, artists, athletes, performers, and production companies to refuse to work in Arizona until officials not only overturn this bill, but recognize the human rights of immigrants. This should include the NBA playoffs, revisiting the actions of the NFL in 1993, when they moved the Superbowl to Pasadena in protest against Arizona\u2019s refusal to recognize Dr. King. We all need to speak up in defense of our brothers and sisters being victimized in Arizona, because things are only getting worse.

You're calling them laborers\nWalk on by and never say hi or consider them neighbors\nSome got the nerve to live in Texas, Arizona, Cali, and not know\nEven missing the cue in \"New Mexico\"\nDiss the Brown brothers and sisters on what they done did\nThis side of the Earth, they built pyramids\nMy passion comes and what I know and who I am\nI refuse to lose or to be confused by this new scam\nScarred by sarcasm, Uncle Sam's racist orgasm\nWas just a spasm scared of enthusiasm\nOf the Black and Brown planet, the jealous say, \"Damn it\"\nStupid ass wall, you can't stop us all\n\n[Hook]EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nNo Buddha bliss, she musta missed it\nStill bangin' with the anger, kissed a soul sanger\nClass of '78, Sunset Strip 'cause I been outta high, twenty years\nWith thirty something-ish peers (Soul)\nWhat a trip, never drank beer with the boys\nBut the love we shared was the art of noise\nDump puffs a smoke, make me cough (Baugh-augh)\nBut I'm not a chimney, so you can't call that shit soft\nWhat turned me off, swore their breath stunk\nPlus, I never got outrhymed by a drunk\nNow, a style is your hair or something you wear\nWho said it's getting suited (Suited) 'til your brain's polluted\nI ain't playin', this main-stain stayin' rooted\nInstead of bein' pimped and then prostituted\nWon't be the last time 'cause it ain't the first\nSo do I dare disturb the universe? (Universe)\n\n[Chorus + scratching]\nGettin' you down like gravity\n(Uh, uh) Gettin' you down like gravity\n(Uh, uh) Gettin' you down like gravity\n(Uh, uh) Gettin' you down like gravity\n\"Goin' down, down, down\n\"Diggy-diggy down\"\n(You don't wanna get shocked!)\n[Verse 2]\nNo U turn, I pump up, hittin' switches\nBut all this talk reflect the niggas & bitches\nWhere did that come from, only labels can explain\nBut they play dumb while they take from\nI hit 'em up the rhyme uppercut\nTell me what they've done for me lately but hate me\nAttack me, might as well be damn Pataki\nThis hip-hop's in me, so they can't stop me\nThe rhyme animal has resurfaced\nWreckin' all elements, destroyin' all irrelevant (Yeah!)\nIt all comes down to this\nWhat good is talkin' about the hood when you got motherfuckin' madness? (Madness)\nAm I ringin' those senses?\nBrothers drinkin' worse shit than they're be pourin' in their Benzes\nI give a damn, so I curse\nSo do I dare disturb the universe? (Universe)\n\n[Chorus + scratching]\n(Uh) Gettin' you down like gravity\n(Uh, uh) Gettin' you down like gravity\n(Uh) Gettin' you down like gravity\n(Uh, uh) Gettin' you down like gravity\n\"Goin' down, down, down\n\"Di-di-diggy-diggy down\"\n(You don't wanna get shocked!)\n[Verse 3]\nSee, I always been a rebel\nNow I got my own kind blind, brain trained on the devil level\nYou don't measure a man by what he got\nIt's what he does, what he's left, and what he's takin' care of\nA brother like me annoys 'em\nBut I'm cool, G, when I rap about 'em, it's poison\nEverybody wanna be Big Willie, chasin' down loot\nDole and Newt, who do you shoot?\nI'm fingerin' targets while ya figurin', \"Figaro, Figaro\"\nSoap opera for the Niggaro\nI ain't chasin' no movies like Jason\nOr Lollapallooza 'cause I ain't no loser\nRough stuff to the babies spread like rabies\nTo the heads of heads, but I ain't crazy\nChorus to the chorus, verse to the verse\nBut do I dare (Dare) to disturb the universe? (Universe)\n\n[Chorus + scratching]\n(Uh) Gettin' you down like gravity\n(Uh) Gettin' you down like gravity\n(Uh, uh) Gettin' you down like gravity\n(Uh) Gettin' you down like gravity\n(Uh) Gettin' you down like gravity\n(Uh, uh) Gettin' you down like gravity\n(Uh) Gettin' you down like gravity\n(Uh, uh) Gettin' you down like gravity\n[Post-Chorus]\nGettin' you down like gravity\nGettin' you down like gravity\nGettin' you down like gravity\nGettin' you down like gravity\nGettin' you down like gravity\nGettin' you down like gravity\nGettin' you down like gravity\nGettin' you down\n\n[Outro]\n\"Yo, it's the Flip Squad!\" (Flip Squad make your head nod)\n\"K.K., Bootleg, and Lady G\"\n\"Representin' true hip-hop!\"\n\"On the Hot 97-5!\"\n\"Word up, y'all!

   "lyrics": "[Verse 1]\nNo mistako, not some wacko from Waco\nCrazy, I'll plead insanity just to save humanity\nBe good like no Johnny, never liked no Giuliani\nCause they never could stop me, not their imaginary Rocky\nGet me then acquit me attack me, what a shock to Pataki\nHere here, watch a brother duck the chair\nI fear only the one upstairs who got no peers\nI'm not part of the clique, it's whatcha see is whatcha get\nMy reality's personal, many times rhymers forget\nSome ain't heavy like others but they still be my brothers\nAnd disgusted at the other folks laughin' at us\nWith the ashes to the ashes, the blunts to the blunts\nA chip off the whole block, I shock and get the word in\nMaybe that's why a brother like me shoulders the burden\nI smells between the white sheets a hell of a beast\nIn the back lurkin', don't front step to the circle\n\n[Hook]\nA plan to that man no doubt\nAlthough I\u2019m feelin alright\nIt\u2019s feelin funny feelin left out\nA plan to that man no doubt\nAlthough i\u2019m feelin alright\nIt\u2019s feelin funny feelin left out\nA plan to that man no doubt\nAlthough i\u2019m feelin alright\nIt\u2019s feelin funny feelin left out\nAnother one falls to Big Willie (yeah)\nCause to some it\u2019s a dream\nBut to the rest it\u2019s a nightmare\n[Verse 2]\nMore time in the air than a flight attendant\nThe rhyme got winded on the way up on what I thought was a lay up\nThese two-cent criticizers can't size\nWe don't realize we all under a microscope of a nation of other folk\nSo all this nigga callin' is we fallin' attitude\nHave we forgotten? Entertaining is today's way of picking cotton\nSo that the younger G\u2019s and B\u2019s think all we can be is a big dreamer\nIn order to get a Benz or a Beamer\nSome stuck in that '96 Lexus per minute shit\nIt's that same old story that bores me, ignores me\nMy metaphors be over that head of even heads\nTo some I'm prophetic, but to the rest I'm pathetic\nI led a movement of mentals against the feds and point spread\nOn beats, mad noise, and funky instrumentals\nThere once was a time we fought the power with a rhyme\nNow the attitude goin' round, no use tryin'\n\n[Hook]\nA plan to that man no doubt\nAlthough i\u2019m feelin alright\nIt\u2019s feelin funny feelin left out\nA plan to that man no doubt\nAlthough i\u2019m feelin alright\nIt\u2019s feelin funny feelin left out\nA plan to that man no doubt\nAlthough i\u2019m feelin alright\nIt\u2019s feelin funny feelin left out\nAnother one falls to Big Willie (yeah)\nCause to some it\u2019s a dream\nBut to the rest it\u2019s a nightmare\n[Bridge]\nYeah..aha\u2026c'mon\u2026 aha,right\u2026\nRide on, ride on yeah\nWe don\u2019t need to be no Big Willie\nLast verse check it out\n(To some it\u2019s a dream, but to the rest it\u2019s a nightmare)\n\n[Verse 3]\nGot more hits than Pete Rose had for the Reds\nNow they be on anything Deion intercepts\nExcept I\u2019m in a zone now get wreck, I get around\nCan I get down like Craig Mack, how can I get down\nBack like rock \u2018em sock 'em robots who forgot it was him\nWho parlayed the styles of KRS & Rakim\nAnd brought it to a different level against the so called devil\nWho had the nerve to throw a bell curve and test me, arrest me\nLemme go, let it grow, no, i\u2019ve been through the afro\nIt\u2019s been a long time so my childhood's retro\nUnlike today as we be watchin us pay\nThe price that bugs me knowin that God don\u2019t like ugly\nGot a free pair of lugs to run quicker from the slugs\nBut slipped from the mad dirt that was swept under the rug\nA lil\u2019 down, but not out, not what you thought it was\nIt\u2019s just peace no beefs, I gets love\n\n[Hook]\nA plan to that man no doubt\nAlthough i\u2019m feelin alright\nIt\u2019s feelin funny feelin left out\nA plan to that man no doubt\nAlthough i\u2019m feelin alright\nIt\u2019s feelin funny feelin left out\nA plan to that man no doubt\nAlthough i\u2019m feelin alright\nIt\u2019s feelin funny feelin left out\nAnother one falls to Big Willie (yeah)\nCause for some it\u2019s a dream\nBut to the rest it\u2019s a nightmare\nA plan to that man no doubt\nAlthough im feelin alright\nIt\u2019s feelin funny feelin left out\nA plan to that man no doubt\nAlthough i\u2019m feelin alright\nIt\u2019s feelin funny feelin left out\nA plan to that man no doubt\nAlthough i\u2019m feelin alright\nIt\u2019s feelin funny feelin left out\nAnother one falls to Big Willie (yeah)\nCause for some it\u2019s a dream\nBut to the rest it\u2019s a nightmareEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

   "lyrics": "[Intro]\n\"Everybody's standing up!\" (Yeah)\n\"Wait a minute\"\n\"Delivery on the way\" (Uh-huh)\nGet it right, or be gone\n\n[Verse 1]\nWay back, just a man, nineteen sixties\nNew York City, I ain't dizzy, that's half-past fifty\nWillie Mays the airwaves, to right from wrong (Uh!)\n(Get it right or be gone!)\nWarnin' track to Johnny, no cash off the bench\nMan in black, you heard who had the damn nerve\nTo dead the N-word\nBrought to you by hot, disturbed, you think not?\n(Get it right or be gone!)\nRun on third, dancin' like some jackal-robbin' son\nStealin' homes, invadin' domes, married to the job\nJob go, you no mo'! Get it?\n(Get it right or be gone!)\nHere's a blooper, ratchet ruler's think they're super\nIf they can call you anything, and they could do anything\nMimicking ways, gimmick kings, calling yourself anything\n(Get it right or be gone!)\nFast because it was so sloppy what I do for hip-hop\nB, let's see, cosigned by the Grandmaster Flash\nAfrika Bambaataa, Kool Herc, DJ Hollywood, I'm good\n(Get it right or be gone!)\nSave a hundred-forty miles per hour struck out to slave\nHarriet would have freed more slaves if they only knew they were slaves\nHip-hop I gave, free the damn airwaves!\nGet it right or be gone!\n[Interlude]\nGet it right, or be gone\n[Verse 2]\nAnd the first place disgracin' the hip-hop birth place\nNo debate, disrespect to self-hate\nFrom them, genicide to juice huddles\nDamn the damn hustle!\n(Get it right or be gone!)\nRain out, crime puddles, part time coach\nDesignated spitter, eight million hip-hop stories on you splitters\nDivide the conquerors, flood the drunkard\n(Get it right or be gone!)\nWild pitch, voice like bricks\nNo studio tricks, 1986 draft pick\nYou know the damn name, shock lock it to the hall of fame\n(Get it right or be gone!)\nAin't no friendly game, next time stay out of the line of fire\nSit yourself in a corner, keep your ass quiet\nS***, hey, I ain't wanna get nobody fired, now\n(Get it right or be gone!)\nKnucklepaw, this ain't no self-destruction\nWe ain't in the same game, I'm pointin' my finger at you\nThe problem is you, shuttin' you down because you tear us down\n(Get it right or be gone!)\nExtra innings spinning since the beginning\nHip-hop been in New York forty years, who the hell think they be winning?\nWhen we all hearin' no balance in the air\nYeah, get it right or be gone!\n[Verse 3]\nA song is more than a record, check it\nA movement is bigger than a song, check\nA mindset is even greater than a movement, keep it movin'\nGet it right or be gone!\nA no-hitter over nine, strived to be civilized\nExcel in mental over physical, styles of those guys\nRapper does good, they hardly pay him any mind\nEvery step of trouble is a cultural landmine\nSo this black snowball rolls up with the flow\nI put the thermostat, turned the heat up, lock all the windows\nAin't gotta use no big words y'all ain't never heard, yeah\n(Get it right or be gone!)\nStill intellectual instead of anti-lectual\nDumbed down and young down, like I don't know a festival\nEpitome of five-thousand shows, Earthizen culturalists\nWhat y'all seeing is a traveling human-being\nGround grew double, rapper in trouble\nSorry Busta, love you, but everything is not a hustle\nRapper does good, press says nothin', y'all better tell these kids somethin'\nGet it right or be gone!\n\n[Outro]\n(Uhh!)\nGet it right, get it right\nGet it right, or be gone!\n(Uhh!)\nYo, take it how you want it\nTake it how you want it\nBe gone!\n[Outro]\nUSA'ers are crippled by the lack of history of geographic knowledge, sometimes not even visiting other states, thus not knowing the Earth equals slavery\nI suggest that the many artists, that they aggressively spread their art to the Earth instead of sitting around wishing a corp makes them a star6EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

   "lyrics": "\"Now, here's a little story I got to tell, about three bad brothers\nYou know so well/it started way back in history/with Ad-Rock, MCA, and Number three: Mike D.\"\n\nThere is no adequate measure for the IMpact that the Beastie Boys had on Public Enemy during our formative years. They were our ROLE models. They gave us some of our richest support, and\nUncharacteristic of many advisors in this game, they led by EXAMPLE\n\nThe very first time the Beastie Boys headlined their own tour - the\nLicensed to Ill tour that hit the road in January of 1987 - they\nInvited us to join the bill. The line-up was the Beasties, Public\nEnemy, and Murphy's Law. Watching them tear it up... night after night... I learned so MUCH about the importance of a great stage show. THEY made me RE-think what Public Enemy was supposed to be doing onstage...and afFIRMED for me how imPORTANT our OWN Beastie Boy - who calls himself Flavor Flav - might be to our success. In that way, the Beastie Boys LITerally helped us to get OUR act together by MORE than living up to their name, night after night on the road. They were - and still ARE - one of the greatest live acts in music\n\nHow could we NOT Learn from way this group has CHALLENGED the conventions in the music business?...How they made their OWN rules about what it meant to be world class hip hop cats. After Licensed to Ill, the Beasties left the Def Jam label, and broke with their producer, Rick Rubin. EVERYONE wondered - and many people were pessimistic - about how the HELL they were going to top their multi-platinum debut. But their second album, Paul's Boutique broke the mold. With it, they accomplished EVERYTHING they'd hoped for. They kept their band together through a challenging period, when most groups would have\nBroken up and gone home. They proved that they could produce\nThemSELVES when too many folks wrongly believed they were Rick's puppets. And they inSISted on maturing as a band and as human beings when the easier thing would have been to come back with a formula that might have been Licensed to Ill 2.0. It was that COURAGE and SELF-RESPECT that Public Enemy learned from, and so like them, we made SURE NEVER to take the easy way out just to repeat a hit record, never to compromise our faith in ourSELVES and in our ARTISTRY\n\nOne of the MOST ADmirable qualities about the Beastie Boys is that they've stayed so TRUE to the game over the years, no matter WHAT was going on - with THEM, or hip-hop culture in GENERAL. As far as I'M concerned, the trend towards individualism in hip-hop has become a PLAGUE. It has CRIPpled the art form. Yet through it all, the Beasties remain a TEAM of emcees, in the STYLE of the groups that INSPIRED them: the Treacherous Three, the Crash Crew, and the 2009 inductees, Run-DMC. And let us not forget their DJs throughout the years: Andre \"Doctor Dre\" Brown, DJ Hurricane; Mixmaster Mike, and DJ Double R, better known as Rick Rubin. In rock'n'roll, a band still gotta be a band. It's the same thing with hip-hop, and the Beasties remain a model for us ALL. BE together. PLAY together. STAY together. ToGETHER forEVER\n\nTime and again, in word and in practice, the Beastie Boys HONOR\nHip-hop's founding templates. As true musicians, they move beyond drum machines and repetitive samples, and sometimes pick up their own instruments. It's their way of paying TRIBUTE to the musicians who PRECEDED them, who built the founDAtions for hip-hop\n\nMore than many, many groups, The Beasties have evolved. In\nParticular, I'm thinking of someone who wasn't able to join us tonight -- Adam Yauch, better known as MCA. But I feel him here tonight, because he belongs here with the GREATEST. It was MCA who COMMITTED the Beasties to their lengthy campaign for freedom for Tibet, a campaign that not only helped to shine a light on Tibet's struggle for independence, but allowed the Beasties to move from fighting for their right to party... to partying for their right to fight\n\nNo matter their lyrical subjects or their onstage parodies, ONE thing The Beastie Boys never were was a joke. They REMIND US that this is a CRAFT... not a hustle. I couldn't be more HONORED to INDUCT this group, because they represent the BEST of the hip hop and rap music. I dig, love, and always THANK them for doing the hard work of PAVING those roads... for musicians all over the world to rock rap and roll on...... ESPECIALLY before people took us seriously as artists\n\nMay we ALL be as PROFESSIONAL, DISTINCTIVE, POWERFUL, AND GROUND BREAKING as THIS group right here. The BEASTIE BOYS are INDEED \"three bad brothers.\" Who MADE history\nThank you4EmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"

   "lyrics": "I used to write a lot. I've been telling myself it's time to write again. But now here I am, writing because it's necessary, because I have a reason at an unfortunate time in my life. This piece is about my Father, my Dad.\nMy Superman.\n\nMy Father is my hero; my Dad is my Superhero. He raised many boys and young men into confident, caring human beings. He shaped me for 55 years on Earth. When I felt lost and a bit off-track, he had some God-given ability to untwist me and put me back into focus.\n\nHe was never afraid of dying. He would simply say that everyone goes to the same door of wherever that is. He would say, \"well, either you're gonna go first or me, unless we're going to be in the same accident which we can make prayer to avoid.\" Anyway, he would add, \"no parent should face burying their child. So there you have it, son, and FYI you are not that far behind me in age\" (he was 22 years older than I am), \"so take care of yourself too.\"\nMy father called me and my brother, \"son.\" He respected religion and God's practices over them, yet he observed a simple practicality and philosophy for the everyday man and woman. He wanted everyone to have an equal chance.\n\nMy Dad was as stand up a man as I ever seen. He championed young fathers, saying that they deserve more credit in today's society. He stood up for women, wives, and mothers just as strongly. Nearly everyone thinks their parent is amazing; I told my father many times he is my Superhero with a heart. The detailed moments I had have with this man are endless...all the way up to the fantastic night he, my brother, I, my two nephews, and a few friends sat over at his house watching Super Bowl 50.\nMy Dad was rooting for Cam Newton because his uncle was my Dad's friend, and Cam is from nearby College Park, Georgia. We were loud - but not overboard - our team has always been the Jets, my brother's team, the Vikings. We were in my Dad's den, where four years ago we were all screaming at each other when the Saints got it (my brother has a big voice too: trust me, it was high volume down there). I tweeted several times about my Dad during SB50, saying he wasn't for all them commercials and the halftime concert. Tweeting the fact if people think I have a powerful voice, it is nothing compared to my Dad's voice... for real.\n\nAs I child, I heard my Dad's voice thunder off walls. It was reminiscent of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and so many other famous orators, but my Dad represented a strong family man. I remember as a teen, knowing when he stepped out the front door to call me, my brother, and/or my sister to get inside, no matter how far you were, you couldn't say you didn't hear him yell. Because everyone else did. In fact, if my father yelled hard at me, it felt like half my face would melt back.\n\nThe \"Dad things\" my father did, he did so well. And we bragged about him like the gift that he was. In the seventies, we had quite a few rough financial times as a Black family, but he and Mom covered them so well we didn't notice. The James Evans-John Amos father on Good Times didn't come close to the very real thing. There are thousands of moments I have to remember. Sometimes we tested our father, and he came back correcting. But I never heard the man curse until I was grown, he kept that side away from us, his kids.\n\nWhere other families figured it would cost too much to travel, my father once found a way to take us on vacation. He bought a car that had no reverse, and he drove us to Canada. My parents figured it out with minimum funds\nMy Dad drove a cab in dangerous 1970s NYC for a few years. I was a teenager and I couldn't sleep until he came through the door around 3am. I got my first jobs with him at 17-18 years old, working shipping and receiving departments for fabric warehouses. I had 14-15 jobs from 1979-1986, culminating in driving furniture in a U-Haul across NYC, a job all of Public Enemy and The Bomb Squad guys did at one time or another before records.\n\nMy dad liked music a lot but he wasn't into the music, he was a solid NY sports fanatic. Born in Harlem in 1938, Lorenzo Douglas Ridenhour (for which the D in my name comes from) was naturally a Brooklyn Jackie Robinson Dodger fan. My Dad was even scouted as a pitcher for the Chicago White Sox, but by then the Marines wouldn't let him try out. For him, it became the Mets, the Knicks, the Jets, and the Rangers, that was it and understood. We cried sport. I got loud that way.\n\nThe music, the cultural side of me comes from my Mom, who also didn't drive until she was in her forties, which meant my Dad drove all of us everywhere. Eventually he even acted as transportation and stage manager for the Roosevelt Community Theatre.\n\nMy Dad always knew my artistic side, but was surprised by the music thing. He prided himself as a Black Man; he demanded and gave Respect without effort. He went fearlessly into places where the average head of a family would question. Regardless of whatever I chose to do, my Father knew he'd raised a man in me, who found a way and a means to bark back at the same hypocrisy he saw every day in so many different forms. So my Dad didn't come to the award shows, very few concerts, and couldn't tell you the names of my albums and songs. In fact we didn't talk about much music at all - ever. I'm not sure if he noticed the recent LeBron James-Terrordome spot I had, a commercial playing in the middle of all his games...perhaps he did.\n\nBut HE IS the lyrics.\nMy brother E says he was THE epitome of 100. I agree,\nMy dad was a very solid 100 straight up. No bullsht.\nHe drove everywhere like a road metronome, and even when I was fortunate enough to help with flights to a few countries, he and my step-Mom drove that turf too. My father met all people as equals was very stand up and gave everybody a chance to come right. In 1979 we drove a Buick 225 across the country to San Francisco and back. We blew a water pump on I-80 at midnight in Lincoln, Nebraska. A town mechanic fixed it because of a conversation my dad had with a state trooper. Dad said people are people but the system tricks 'em. We repeated half that drive in 2012 in a truck. I picked him up in Dallas and we talked and drove all the way into Georgia.\n\nAlas. The details of the times with my father are endless to remember and perhaps they will attack my mind like black blizzard flakes, and I will find a patch of road to weep at the wheel. In recent years with my Dad in retirement, I made it my obligation to get to Atlanta once a month no matter what. He'd pick me up, take me to the crib and to my car. And after the trip was done, he'd drop me off back at the airport after we did breakfast. I recently ordered the same NBA game package that I'd initially gotten for him 3 years ago, all so we could call each other on a play.\n\nRecently, there was something calling in me. After I spoke at UPenn on 2.6.16 I went to sit all day in my Dad's den to watch Super Bowl 50. It was the grandest of times. After the game I offered to take my nephew and long-time PE founding member and SIW, James Norman, to their respective homes. Before we left, my Dad told us how in 1956, while he was in Marine Camp Lejeune, the nearby restaurant told him they wouldn't serve Negroes. He laughed, remembering when Dick Gregory, recalling a similar experience, retorted that he didn't eat Negroes either. My Dad also talked about how much he dug President Obama and never dug all the criticism about him. My Dad proceeded to tell some other jokes he'd heard on one of Dick Gregory's 1960s albums. We laughed so much. I kissed my Dad on both sides of his face, rubbed his back, and said I loved him much and he told me the same. I was out the door.\n\nMy Dad passed away alone at home the next afternoon, while I was taking my mom to lunch with my sister and brother-in-law. My Superhero....real father ...real man and more...I never had no need for any cartoon-, sports-, singer-, avatar-, or film-figure. I had the real thing.\n\nIn these millennial times, my Dad saluted fathers. Especially young black fathers where he said the props were not enough and society cast a bad one-sided light against them. He would continuously praise me as the best father he knew; I always shook my head and told him I was a chip off the block of the greatest. He'd pour it on me: \"Fathers matter.\" Yes, Black fathers matter more than ever.\n\nI'm missing his voice bellowing my name through my house. Missing our get-together breakfast-to-the-airport ritual. It's a painful absence that can never be overstated...\n\nPeace, resPEct, Love... Forever\nDaddy\n\nYour son and family,\nChuckEmbedShare URLCopyEmbedCopy"
