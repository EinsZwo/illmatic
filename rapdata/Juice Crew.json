  "plain": "In the mid-80s, producer Marley Marl assembled a group of rappers from Queensbridge including MC Shan, Biz Markie, Big Daddy Kane, Kool G Rap, Masta Ace, Roxanne Shante, and others and called them The Juice Crew. Each rapper released songs individually on Marley\u2019s Cold Chillin' record label, but also recorded a handful of collaborative efforts together under various names like \u201cJuice Crew\u201d, \u201cJuice Crew All Stars\u201d and \u201cCold Chillin' Juice Crew\u201d.\n\nThe Juice Crew had a famous rivalry started by Boogie Down Productions, rappers from the Bronx, who responded to Shan\u2019s song \u201cThe Bridge\u201d, a song about Queens, with tracks like \u201cSouth Bronx\u201d and \u201cThe Bridge Is Over\u201d. The rivalry ended years later, and KRS-One (of BDP) and Marley Marl made an album together named Hip Hop Lives in 2007. On one track, KRS explains:\n\nTo Marley and Shan I am indebted\nFor the start of my career these guys could take credit\nFor my rapping, the whole battle, they let it happen"

(Nay!)\nI tried to tell the blind, the deaf, the dumb\nThat there will be a day we shall overcome\nI said freedom and justice was around the bend\nI spoke the people rights that marks all men\nHave faith in me, I'm a man of trust\nI was jailed for protesting the seats on the bus\nOn the day [?]\nI said 'Til we gonna reach that mountaintop\nStrive for perfection and keep your pace steady\nAnd when the doors open, you best be ready\nA good black lawyer, a good black teacher\nA good black driver or a good black preacher\nIf you wanna take seconds, be my guest\nI'll be a good black nothing, I'm gonna be the best\nTry to make it better than it was in the past\nScream to the world that we're free at last!\n\n[Chorus: TJ Swan]\nWe came here tonight to get started\n[?] party\nCame a long way, now we're here to stay\nAnd now we're here to talk about it today\nOn Today\nWe came here tonight to get started\n[?] party\nCame a long way, now we're here to stay\nAnd now we're here to talk about it today\nTodayEmbed"
