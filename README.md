# illmatic

Project to build and analyze a corpus of rap lyrics.

Lyrics are pulled from the Genius.com APIs.
They are then parsed to find specific artists who perform a given verse (which may be different from the song's artist, e.g. as a feature.)
Annotate and store those lyrics as an XML document.
Note that to avoid copyright issues, I avoid putting the corpus itself in this repository.
